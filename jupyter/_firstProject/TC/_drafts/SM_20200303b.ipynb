      "I think you're confused in regards to the definition of state. I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word \"\"state\"\" than the \"\"US state\"\" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are \"\"states\"\". The terms \"\"state\"\", \"\"nation\"\" and \"\"country\"\" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words \"\"state\"\", \"\"nation\"\" and \"\"country\"\" are all translated as \"\"國\"\" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction. The Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China is called \"\"中華民國國防部\"\" (國 = nation), the United Nations is called \"\"聯合國\"\" (國 = nation), the United States Department of State is called \"\"美國國務院\"\" (國 = state), the Commonwealth of Independent States is called \"\"獨立國家聯合體\"\" (國 = state),  and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is called \"\"石油輸出國組織\"\" (國 = country).

      "\n",
      "Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94\n",
      "\n",
      "This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97\n",
      "\n",
      "Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104\n",

      "It is true that I can not read urdu but this is not the point which i want to make. My point if simple, on wikipedia we are not usually encourage to put our own point of views. For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly. And we are here to be neutral even we dont belief on such things, did not give us right to present information which is offensive to any one, no matter which faith he or she belongs... regards..\n",

I've been on wikibreak for a while so I haven't been able to follow what happened with the big \"\"plagiarism on the main page\"\" discussion.

I actually did not intend to become a \"\"main driver\"\" of the plagiarism discussion, nor did I intend to become \"\"Plagiarism Central\"\", but alas and alack, so it has turned out )  What fueled that whole thing was me trying to discover how the \"\"reward culture\"\" on Wiki was fueling plagiarism and copyvio at DYK to feed ill-prepared RFA candidates, and I never expected the problem to turn out to be as big as it has.  Anyway, I think we can summarize what has happened with that discussion as 1) slightly more awareness of plagiarism and copyvio on Wiki; 2) much more work for our few qualified copyvio people; 3) little change that I've been able to detect at DYK or ITN (but I don't follow closely enough); 4) circling of the wagons curiously in defense of copyvio by some ArbCom members and some extremely distasteful commentary coming from some arbs; and 5) curiously, even some resistance at FAC to tightening procedures to detect copyvio, with a second copyvio getting through FAC only a week after the Halloween mainpage debacle.   On the copyvio you detected above, I'm not certain you handled it correctly by stubbifying the article, rather than adding the  tag and alerting the copyvio people, you don't allow them to 1) look for other copyvios by the same author, 2) educate that author, and 3) remove the copyvio from article history.  You might want to go through those steps as well.   As to the lack of mainpage scrutiny, I 'spose it will take time, a few more debacles, and a few less unprofessional arbs before the issue is taken seriously.   (Talk) \"\n",

Instead of talking about what kind of music or vocals are used, time is wasted on lyrical content. Those are words. Lyrics do not define music genres. Anyone can write a song about any topic they want. The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how it's played. Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on? It was either a yelling/screaming type vocal from hardcore, or they would actually just talk in the songs like how bands like Indian Summer and Moonraker did. Genre is how you play, not what you say.

Also confusing was the fact that even in the case of overlap between cultures, the steps had differing names.\n",

      "The making of humanity Robert Briffault Publisher G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1919 Original from the University of California Digitized Oct 18, 2007\n",
      "It must be admitted that, in recoil from the general conspiracy of silence of our histories, several writers who have sought to vindicate the claims of Arab culture have somewhat exaggerated the achievements of Arabian science. Against such loose panegyrics it has been objected, that Arab science produced no surpassing genius and no transcending discovery ; that it was derived from extraneous sources. That is substantially true, but entirely irrelevant. Arab astronomy did not forestall Copernicus or Newton, though without it there would have been no Copernicus and no Newton. Although the complexity of the Ptolemaic system was repeatedly criticized by Moorish astronomers, although Al-Zarkyal declared the planetary orbits to be ellipses and not circles, although the orbit of Mercury is in Al-Farani's tables actually represented as elliptical, although Muhammad Ibn Musa glimpsed in his works on Astral Motion and The Force of Attraction the law of universal gravitation, those adumbrations of the truth were not fruitful of any great reform. The only important facts brought to light by Arabian astronomy, the discovery of the movements of the sun's apogee by Al-Batani, and of the secondary variations of the moon's motion by Abu '1-Wafa, exercised no perceptible influence upon the course of research, and had to be rediscovered by Tycho. Ibn Sina is said to have employed an air thermometer, and1 Ibn Yunis certainly did use the pendulum for the measurement of time ; but neither of those devices, which were independently re- introduced by Galileo, can be counted as a contribution to the growth of science.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, however, is entirely beside the point. The debt of our science to that of the Arabs does not consist in startling discoveries or revolutionary theories; science owes a great deal more to Arab culture, it owes its existence. The ancient world was, as we saw, pre-scientific. The astronomy and mathematics of the Greeks were a foreign importation never thoroughly acclimatized in Greek culture. The Greeks systematized, generalized and theorized, but the patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to the Greek temperament. Only in Hellenistic Alexandria was any, approach to scientific work conducted in the ancient classical world. What we call science arose in Europe as a result of a new spirit of inquiry, of new methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation, measurement, of the development of mathematics in a form unknown to the Greeks. That spirit and those methods were introduced into the European world by the Arabs.\n",
      "Is  Briffault's writing wp:npov? Not when cut and pasted, only when taken in context. The emphasis in this quote is mine, however wp:rs will show that systems and theories of science in the middle ages are those of Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and Euclid. As for the spirit and methods we need a more neutral tone.\n",

      "Shapiro is no more notable than medical doctors who have had their licenses suspended, or revoked.  I can think of one doctor (a former doctor of mine) who had his license revoked for killing a woman with the improper use of anesthesia, insurance fraud, falsely advertising he was board certified when he was never eligible to be board certified, and by the time the state attorney got involved (which is what it took to get this doctor's license revoked in ONE state), three criminal counts of sexual assault.  It took 9 years for this doctor to lose his license.  It was in the local newspapers.  Evidently, this all wasn't enough for national news.  And there is no political group called \"\"Overdoctored\"\".  Would any of you think this doctor warrants a WIkipedia entry?  Sadly, there was no news about state medical boards revising their ethics rules.  This man is now in New York, and of course, not practicing medicine - it took awhile for the three other states in which he was licensed to catch up with him.  Yet this man is not infamous.  Why not?  If a lawyer can be castigated in WIkipedia for misleading advertising, why don't we just begin a whole slew of articles about other sleazy lawyers, and doctors, and accountants, and....  Is Wikipedia now a forum for releasing one's own dislike of a particular profession?   \"\n",

      "Thanks for your comment.  I don't get much feedback about my translations.  I think the problem you have identified may be something other than a translation problem.  I have simply done a literal translation of the German text.  The comparison is with classification type A.  An R class loco will have been engineered to be able to go around corners faster than its A class equivalent.  So, eg, an Re 6/6 (bogie type Bo-Bo-Bo) loco will have a higher maximum cornering speed than an Ae 6/6 (bogie type Co-Co - less flexible).  The difference is particularly important on the Gotthardbahn, which is a very busy line with sharp curves.  This point is not made very clearly in the de.wiki article, perhaps because German speakers are likely to be much more familiar than English speakers with the Gotthardbahn.  Also, the first table in both articles is not as clear as the second table.  I would be happy to alter the first table in the en.wiki article a bit if you think that's appropriate.  Also, the word \"\"higher\"\" may be a less confusing word to use than \"\"increased\"\", even though the two words have slightly different meanings, and the latter is a more correct translation.   \"\n",

Not everyone drives a train, but obviously trains are a very important part of the efficient, affordable bulk transportation of goods.  Whether or not they are in common use, they are there every day on Canadian railways and every race at the track.  This isn't a popularity contest, it's merely a statement of things as they exist in certain aspects of transportation in Canada.

      "Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~\"\n",

      "One of the great things about Bayesian stats is that you can do things directly rather than indirectly, as in frequentist stats. For example, in frequentist stats you can't attach a probability to a hypothesis, so you can't talk about the probability of the hypothesis given the data. Instead, you have to mess around with the probability of the data given the hypothesis, which is not really what you want. Bayesian hypothesis testing is thus very simple in principle (though the sums may get hard in practice). You attach a prior probability to the hypothesis, multiply by the likelihood and divide by the probability of he evidence to normalise it. The point I was making was that probabilities of zero and one make poor choices as priors. (I am not saying that Bayesian stats generally has a problem with zero and one as probabilities, just when they are used as priors.) Your mention of linear models and so on suggests that you are thinking in terms of Bayesian methods of parameter estimation, whereas I was thinking in terms of Bayesian hypothesis testing. 15:28, 20\n",

      "   Hi.  I'm not familiar with Doyle or the topic in general, but perhaps I can give you a sense of whether there should/shouldn't be an article on Doyle. With biographies of living people, there are two hurdles on this Wiki, and they largely overlapverifiability and notability. In both cases, usually the question boils down to this:  are there enough reliable, secondary sources that tell us about the subject that we can read them all, and from those sources alone write a reasonably neutral and factual article? In general such sources are going to be things like newspaper articles, magazine articles and books from reliable publishers, anything with a real editorial staff. No press releases, no use of the fellow's own web site, Facebook page, videos, etc.  For athletes like this it's also possible to fill in additional information from reliable databases of results, but notability really requires articles that discuss the subject in some level of detail. Take a look at [{WP:GNG]], and see if that helps you decide.  looks to be at least one such source,  is a reliable reference but only mentions Doyle in passing. Of the 5 sources listed on streetstunts, 4 are don't meet these requirements, and the fifth might or might notI can't tell since the page is dead.  Looks from what I can tell \"\"borderline\"\" with respect to our policies, but since you know the subject in more detail than I do (or at least I assume so) you probably know of specific resources I'm unaware of that might help flesh out the article. I hope this helps, at least a bit.  Cheers, talk to me \"\n",

Initially I was going to say that the Public Relations Officers who wrote those articles may have inserted the term without thinking (or knowing).  However one possibility is that since ISAF is a reaction to the Bonn Agreement, it may be considered peacekeeping with the parties including the fledgling national government and the various quasi-legitimate warlords.  But the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are not parties to any agreement.  To my understanding, without an agreement in place between sides, there is no peacekeeping.  \"\"Security Assistance\"\" (the SA in ISAF) to me is a subset of the military term \"\"peace support operations\"\" (peacekeeping is another subset of peace support operations).  In the end, I think the NATO and ISAF webpages must be authoritative, and I have seen no mention of the term \"\"peacekeeping\"\" on any of the main documents I have looked at.  I don't claim to be an authority, and soldiers (and bureaucrats, and politicians) argue about the meaning of words all the time, but to me 'peacekeeping' has a specific meaning that ISAF does not fit.   \"\n",

Whereas article talk pages were general and public, user talk pages were personal and private. They were different and very different from each other. I thought they were personal and private. I thought they were different and very different from each other. When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion, I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles, not the talk pages of users. Although general discussion wasn't allowed in the talk pages of articles, which were public, I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users, which were personal and private. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part.

That was different, perhaps very different, from general discussion, or discussion of any sort. I thought it was different. Whereas discussion is two-way and consists of several people talking together, sending messages is, or can be, just one-way, involving and being done by just one person, or both. Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance, sending messages doesn't need or involve sending responses or replies. The user of the talk page doesn't need to write anything in response, I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to. The messages and requests sent were not general either. They were special and specific, sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation. Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user, not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk. I thought that was a reason why they weren’t discussion. If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk, it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other, in a public place. But it was done in the talk page of a user, it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him, one way, in a private place.

I didn’t think it would be really that bad. I thought it would just either result in no response from you, another warning from you, or a block that is at least not indefinite. There were actually several reasons why it's not really that bad, or at least I thought it wasn't that bad. First, it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents, facts, statements, and information, etc. It wasn't damage or disruption because it was adding information, not changing or removing information. It was added in a user talk page, a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic. Second, it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia. It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see, read, and look at those edits, or would just need to do so, and so you don't really even need to care or mind about it, at least not too much. Third, they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages, or they might even be glad to see them. Fourth, even if they didn't like having those edits being on their talk pages, they could simply delete and remove it, or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else, or simply just ignore it. Fifth, if you don't like them you could simply go to my Special:Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits.

I would like to assemble editors who are against that decision, and also formulate arguments against the decision. There is a discussion on my talk page between me & another editor, and my argument was, for example: Parker is a surname of English language origin (in turn from French). It may be borne by individuals of various ethnicities/nationalities, but that doesn't mean we must add the cat Category:Latvian surnames or Category:Italian surnames to Parker, just because some individuals of that ethnicity/nationality may have the name (of expatriot origin, etc.).\n",

In all skins the three choices you mention are available, but the \"\"+\"\" (or \"\"post a comment\"\" - it's this in classic as well, which is the skin I usually use) doesn't exactly take you to the bottom - it's more like \"\"edit a section\"\" but for creating a new section which when you hit submit is added to the bottom.

He then went travelling in 1926/1928 to London, Berlin, Paris and back to London. Also, when Francis was born in Ireland under British rule he would be British by his passport and then he would be automatically Irish by 1922  and could later reclaim his British nationality  which there is no evidence that he did. So he's irish until proven otherwise. Further to that it threatens the credibility of Wikipedia if a survey of people decide he is British because they think so.

      " Might I ask what you mean by not REAL? Are you talking about the fact that he is NOT a King of a country? And that he is IN FACT the DE FACTO King of the Blasket Islands? The son of the first unofficially recognized titular monarch of the Blaskets since the \"\"great departure (when the indigenous inhabitants left the islands)?\"\" King Richard is just a King as the former King of Greece or just as Royal as the Princes of Russia or Germany. His Majesty DID NOT say that illegitimate German Nobility inherited titles. He simply said that Prince Albert's new title of Count de Grimaldi would be inherited to his descendents just as the titles of the former Royal and Noble German States; equal inheritance, which means (in case you did not know) that ALL children of a Count would gain the style of Count or Countess. That's all His Majesty was saying; NOTHING more. Everything else you said was pure \"\"make-believe\"\" (on your part). When we look at articles of FORMER Royalty or Nobility, or their descendents, such as you say are nt \"\"real,\"\" do we not see their \"\"not real\"\" titles listed as their titles?

Professor Wessely is a psychiatrist, and for nearly twenty years he has promulgated the idea that ME and the broader groupings of chronic fatigue illnesses (CFS) are the product of ‘false illness beliefs’, mental aberrations, which can be diagnosed and treated with psychiatric based therapies and anti-depressants. \n",
      "\n",
      "TABProfessor Wessely carries out research mainly in the London-based Institute of Psychiatry which is situated in King’s College teaching hospital. He is a member of numerous research organisations and advisory groups, and is advisor to the British Armed Services. While his membership of an ‘official’ web of research organisations tell us a lot about his work, added substance to his views is to be found in his more informal and less renowned associations with a number of minority-view groups set up by, or aligned with US and British ‘quackbuster’ organisations. \n",

      "TABJust before Christmas 2005, the Wikipedia, an electronic and sometimes publicly edited encyclopaedia, was host to a small, anonymous entry about Professor Wessely. The entry appeared to have originated with someone opposed to Wessely’s psychiatric view of ME. On seeing this entry, Jane Bryant of the One Click (OC) campaign substituted a longer text, which contained not just biographical facts but a broader description of Wessely’s role in the politics of ME. \n",

On writing to the owner and founder of Wikipedia, ‘Jimbo’ Wales, in an attempt to put their case, the OC campaign received a personal communication from him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although Wales, aimed at a slight up-beat and reconciliatory tone in his e-mail, the text was scattered with veiled insults. He accused One Click participants of ‘behavioural problems’, while stating that OC organisers had lied and purposefully made libellous statements in their posted piece on Wessely. He made clear even at this early stage of the exchange that Wikipedia would from then on act on the basis that ‘anything from your site (will be treated) with extreme scepticism.’ Jimbo Wales, ended his e-mail with an exhortation for everyone to settle differences and unit in the spirit of Wikichristmas. \n",

      "\"do you accept the stereotype that women are innately less sexually driven than men? You write that \"\"Almost all transsexual women want the sex drive reduced significantly, and reasons for this are psychological. We are not becoming 'something else.'\"\" Yet if your sex drive is reduced significantly, then you ARE becoming something very unlike a real women. Why? Because healthy real women have sex drives just as strong as men's, if not stronger. You are becoming a man who has been chemically and cosmetically altered into a facsimile of femininity; a stereotypical pseudo-woman. You are NOT a real woman; you are a man with a low sex drive and clearly an equally low opinion of real women. You never stopped to ask yourself whether 'female hormones' would have the same effect on your adult male body as they do on genuine females. You never paused to wonder whether your male body requires different testosterone levels compared to a woman's in order to achieve the same level of sex drive. After all, one of the cardinal beliefs of the sex change industry is that men and women are different  right? So why do you consider these differences only when they favor your delusions? So \"\n",

How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.\"\" \n",

      "\n",
      "RESOLUTION 162\n",
      "\n",
      "THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:\n",

      "a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)\n",

      "No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. \n",
      "\n",
      "Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. \n",

      "Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you\n",

      "Chartalists don't guarantee a job.  They merely argue that the role of government in cases of underutilization is to provide the necessary demand to resolve that situation, since otherwise you have unused capacity and net economic loss.  It's quite a jump to take that and conclude the government hires everyone who isn't employed; in fact, it often means the government becomes the customer of a lot of businesses.  If you are in a state of underutilization that represents an economic loss, and it's due to a demand problem, it means you must have some net fiscal expansion from some source in order to drive utilization.  If the private sector is attempting to build assets (run a surplus) and you have an external deficit, the only mathematical means of accomplishing this is public deficit, that is, the government is either hiring people or buying from the private sector.  So the section I've marked for expert review needs to recognize that Chartalists prescribe that government deals with unemployment not by guaranteeing a job, but by hiring more and/or spending i.e. buying more from the private sector.  Things could easily, and likely would, weigh more towards the second option.   (posting on behalf of one Filburt)\"\n",

Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday.

      "The FIDESZ-MPP are nationalists, and very likely ultra-nationalists. Why? First of all, a number of mass media articles and other coverage, both domestic (Hungarian) and foreign, have concluded, based on their actions, statements, rallies, and their own admission, that they are nationalists or ultra-nationalists. Something I witnessed in Budapest during the elections in 2002: FIDESZ-MPSZ (the part after the hyphen has changed over and over) told their voters, most of whom do not deny being nationalists, to wear the national colors pin, or cocard, and carry Hungarian flags during the elections, at all times if possible, to show that they are true, patriotic Hungarians, unlike the MSZP and their junior SZDSZ, who, acccording to FIDESZ, are traitors of the nation!!! Of the total Hungarian voting population at least 50% of them favor MSZP, SZDSZ, and an assortium of other progressive parties or the relatively moderate MDF! In fact, Mrs. Ibolya David, head of the MDF (Magyar Demokrata Forum) broke up with Mr. Viktor Orban and have since been bitter rivals for the affections of the right-wing voters!!! Anyway, I will not put the term \"\"nationalists\"\" or \"\"ultra-nationalists\"\" myself, since I was the first to notice the ommission, but I strongly suggest it should be done for historic accuracy's sake. FIDESZ-MPP are more like Austrian Jorg Haider's Freedom Party than Wolfgang Schussel's Conservative Party. Ultimately anyone concerned can contact Amnesty International or French Conservative party (Chirac will no longer take Orban's calls...wonder why...and Angela Merkel of Germany would not come to Hungary to show up for Viktor during the 2006 Spring elections...hmmm...). \"\n",

Hugger fans are no different from any other ceiling fan in any way, except for the fact that they don't have a downrodsomething which is entirely unrelated to the fan's operation. The motor, blades, etc. is no different. Refer to the section \"\"Bases for Comparison\"\", subsection \"\"Height of the fan relative to the ceiling\"\", for more info on huggers if you're interested. That section details their sole disadvantage; it is appropriate for it to be in that section since it is not a problem unique to huggers (though all huggers have it). The sole advantage of a hugger is that it saves spacesomething which is such blatantly obvious common sense that it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article (any more than the statement \"\"water is wet\"\" belongs in the article on water). Basically my point is that huggers are no different from ordinary fans, and so don't deserve their own section any more than each decor-themed fan at Home Depot deserves its own section.\"\n",

They are understandable as he intended them- the use  of feedback bypasses  the  inadequacies of the nonlinear, variable, and uncontrollable properties of the large-gain open loop amplifier, as very easily seen in the gain analysis that shows the closed-loop gain to be set at 1/β, as fixed by a resistor divider, for example, by making the closed-loop gain 'independent entirely'' of the open-loop gain.

MLB did not recognize co-champions, allowing only Houston to raise a banner indicating that they won the Division Championship and print the same in their media guide. By contrast, in college athletics in the United States it is routine to recognize as co-champions any teams that finish tied for 1st without applying tiebreakers. This is because the recognition of a champion is in the hands of the organizing body. Here is a great example of the phenomenon I'm talking about: http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3033084. The story says that the \"\"Detroit Pistons clinched the Central Division and the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.\"\" Consistent usage here: http://www.democratherald.com/articles/2007/04/11/sports/national/6nat01_nbawest.txt.

A UN brokered cease-fire went into effect on Jan 1, 1949. In all, 1,500 soldiers died on each side during the war and Pakistan was able to acquire roughly two-fifths of Kashmir which it established as Azad Kashmir, meaning free Kashmir.

      "This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.\n",

I was not \"\"jumping all over you\"\" by providing a technical insight which is significant.  And additionally, I never in any way called all rapes supposed crimes; I simply pointed out that German women who viewed themselves as liberated from Nazism or war lived under a regime which would have deported them to concentration camps for having any sexual involvement with anyone considered untermenchlich, could have decided to reward or celebrate with the liberators and then obviously for their own protection claimed that they were raped when Nazis came asking about it.  Additionally, they could have been Nazis, or related to Nazis, and would not have been able to confess Russophilia. Do you realize that I am a racially German girl living in the United States?  The level of emotion in your personal attack demonstrates a level of fanatism that is very strange.  I also never addressed and therefore never condemned you suggestion that women should have a voice.  If that is something that you want, than it is on you to persue it; we are busy with our own research and cannot do yours for you.  However, I will warn you that you should be very cautious about believing anything written by German women, as they may likely be Nazis, and will have a very biased approach to recording the mass rape by the Russians, and would likely outright exaggerate it; many Nazi women openly admit to Western historians that they greatly exaggerated the rape of the Red Army for pro Nazi and anti Communist causes for Gobbels.\n",

      "Ethnologue version 14 (valid from 2000 to 2005) contains different information from Ethnologue version 15 (from 2005 onwards). Any person qualified to write on Greece would know that there was no census in Greece in 1986 (they happen every 10 years so the nearest ones were 1981 and 1991) and that the last time \"\"mother tongue\"\" and \"\"most frequently used language\"\" were asked in a Greek census was 1951. The number for the \"\"mother tongue\"\" question (the other number for frequently used language was even smaller) did make it into Ethnologue v.14 but Ethnologue v.15 for reasons that can only be guessed (pretty easily I may add) chose to come up with a fake census and a figure in the 200k region. Anyone that has enough brains to pass a thesis examination for a Ph.D. (as Taivo has) is capable of looking at the differences between Ethnologue v.14 and Ethnologue v.15 and noticing suspicious changes based on sources dated before 2005. A clear example is in Arvanitika: v14 claims (correctly - I wish I knew how many speakers there were left) a range between 50,000 (Newmark) to 140,000 possible speakers (1977 Trudgill and Tzavaras). v15 comes up with 150,000 (2000) without a clear attribution (what happened in 2000) or an explanation of how a language in clear decline increased in numbers. Moreover v15 creates a new category of 10k speakers of Tosk Albanian for the region of Epirus; this is now separate from Arvanitika despite the fact that the page on Arvanitika still includes the reference to a Northwestern Arvanitika dialect from v14 that could only have referred to the region of Epirus. There is a clear inference (from the text as well) that the inclusion of this new category is related to the political issue of the Cham expulsion (and the claims about \"\"Orthodox Chams\"\"). Finally the very concept of what these numbers mean is in doubt. The north of the village of Andros is mentioned for Arvanitika: bilingualism in our families ended with our grandparent's generation. Extremely few among our parent's generation could converse in Arvanitika - the rest retained a few words or curses and our generation still has those (if at all). To portray the area as Arvanitika speaking is so misleading that it can only be done on purpose.\n",

Until then use of non-existent census figure in Ethnologue makes a mockery of the academic standards they so passionately purport to be trying to uphold.\"\n",

The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.\n",

It is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain.

They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of \"\"isms.\"\" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a \"\"strongman\"\" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a \"\"dictator\"\".

Perhaps the 98% figure pertains to the remaining 90% which would be something like 88.2% of the total population. I think all this speculation qualifies as original research though. What is interesting is the question of \"\"what are the Roma (Gypsies/Τσιγγάνοι)?\"\" According to the Greek government again, they number about 200,000 - are they included in the ethnic Greeks figure? According to official statistics again (1991 census), the Thrace minority is 0.98% of the total population at that time (about 28.8% of the total population of Thace at that time).

      "Yes, being paid alters judgement. So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).\n",
      "There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.\n",
      "First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.\n",
      "Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.\n",
      "Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.\n",

This is not disputed by the UN or the international community. In addition, Israel is in violation of UN resolution 242, the 2002 UN , on Torture, as well as other well documented human rights abuses. To not mention these at all and to just point the finger at the Palestinians for violating international law does a great disservice to this article and makes it have a very biased POV.

The use of flags is, for the third time, a graphic means of presenting information instead of saying England, England, England, England, England, England, oh! Wales, England, England, etc., ad nauseum. It is NOT \"\"purely to render some colourful graphics\"\". The use of graphics to convey information is widespread in all spheres of communication, not just the internet. As for folk using it in other articles, well, if they do then that presents a consensus, doesn't it? No, the match was not an international but the nationalities of the players are relevant in football because for the last thirty-odd years since the arrivals of Ardiles and Villa, nationality has been and still is a burning issue in English football. There are people now who will reluctantly admit that Liverpool have more top-class English players than anyone else at present but still criticise the club for employing South Americans.

      "Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  \"\n",

      "PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL OLANICH, ON MARCH 31ST, 2015\n",
      "telemarketing2014\n",
      "\n",
      "ONE MONTH ago, we gave the Southern Poverty Law Center the benefit of the doubt concerning their dubious telemarketing practices. Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:\n",
      "\n",
      "2011:  -$212,214\n",
      "\n",
      "2012:  -$869,686\n",
      "\n",
      "2013: -$1,156,765\n",
      "\n",
      "2014:  -$1,130,680\n",
      "\n",
      "How in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?\n",
      "\n",
      "But that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "But think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor till\n",
      "\n",
      "THIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.\n",

      "Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

I notice that he has been systematically deleting information related to conservative Christians and conservative Christian organizations. He mutiliates where he cannot delete. And he adds information in such a clever manner that even what is right leads to humiliation. (An apology can be more humiliating than an insult). What is more, I notice that none, repeat NONE, has been able to stop his adventures. He is freely doing what he wants to and none of you has been able to stop him from his anarchy. Else, show me one example where any of you has stopped him in his tracks. Why is it that he has always got to be right??? His POVs are NPOVs while researched stuff by us is POV or simply garbage because there is no arbitrator between him and me. Just show me one example of arbitration in my case. I also notice that others who contributed to this article on Johnson C. Philip are not raising their voice. I know one of them (my junior who also did research on Philip). He told me he would never come back to Wiki, so disappointed was he also to see Arbustoo having his way and none of you coming to arbitration.

From what I can see Margetic does not talk about the title, he talks about the sovereign entity which is obvious since from 1091 Croatia was in deep anarchy caused by the succession crisis and the subsequent claim by the Hungarian Arpad dynasty. And I actually read what Margetic says and he clearly states Stjepan was in fact recognized by the Pope and styled himself King of Croatia and Dalmatia. Following the end of succession crisis and the victory of Arpad's Coloman continues in same fashion and styles himself rex Croatie atque Dalmatie. You seem to have confused the name of the article with the infobox use of official titles/names. Those are two different things.

If the facts I've written are wrong then you clearly ought first to make changes to the peak oil article where there are some who can argue the toss with you. If however you dispute the facts, then again you ought to check the peak oil article and make sure that it adequately notes contrary points of view (if you can source them) - but that does not in itself negate the need for the link. But on your specific point - its a bit rich having someone complain about peak oil which has a proven record of making at least some verifiable predictions within a few years when Global warming is still at the stage of a 3:1 range between lowest and highest predictions!\n",

      "First, until 3 weeks ago, I had never heard the term, \"\"meat puppet\"\".   Perhaps you're trying to make the term mean exactly what you want it to mean, no more and no less.  (Shades of Alice in Wonderland, I suppose.)  I will have to find the definition of that term.  But I view it as a problem when self-selected, biased individuals (even if there is no actual coordination involved) seem to coordinate their postings.  Dodo ran away, that's a fact.  He didn't address my actual criticisms of his actions:  he simply threw a few templates, as if that was the end of the argument.  (But, those templates were not merely mis-applied, they also did not address the entire subjects of the dispute.)  Dodo couldn't be bothered to address them, and for a 'good' (at least, for him!) reason:  If Dodo had to actually discuss his misconduct, and debate the propriety not merely of the original post, but also his own misdeeds, then Dodo would be so busy he couldn't continue his 'drive-by reversions' of peoples' articles.  Dodo was unwilling to explain why he deleted all of my edits, repeatedly.  He was unwilling to explain why he didn't wait for consensus.  Etc.\n",
      "And, it is a fact that 'nobody' addressed Dodo's (at least arguable) misconduct, even if (hypothetically) they also objected to something I did, too.  Why should that be?  There's an 'excellent' reason:  I think the kind of people who did post (self-selected, of course, one would expect) may very well have felt they were defending 'one of their own'.  I repeat my point that if I had time (and access to reversion/deletion statistics) it would probably be obvious that those persons who felt the need to speak up generally engaged in a pattern of activity similar to that of Dodo: Revert, Revert, Revert!   And, not to bother with any 'consensus'.  (\"\"We don't need no stinkin' consensus!\"\").  Such persons would be fearful of 'outing' Dodo's pattern of action, and similarly fearful of someday being hit with similar criticism.  Am I wrong?  I invite somebody else to study their statistics, and explain why there's no 'pattern' there.\n",

So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.). I have heard that Famitsu is considered Japan's premier video game magazine so I think that its reviews for Japanese games are particularly helpful, and I have been adding them to gaming articles recently, but thanks for bringing my attention to GAMEST too. If I happen to pick up any copies of it I'll try to add reviews from there as well. Cheers, -\n",

If we cant trust the independence of scientist and engineers, the world is in danger. \"\"it was a NIST guy\"\": citation needed, and if true, was he alone or did he represent consensus among his peers? You might be true that there has not been any peer review so far, but by publishing their report they open their work for review by peers. And note that the reputation of NIST is at play here, if some  outside expert can find a major error in their simulations, it should be published in peer reviewed literature and, given consensus in the field about the error, NIST would have to retract its claims. Your words: '\"\"new phenomenon\"\" that is still not clearly explained'. NIST report: new phenomenon that IS explained by basic physics, please read the report and don't distort facts there. \"\"altering input to match the results\"\": this is pretty standard in the simulation business to account for uncertainties in your model and is allowed as long as you alterations are within reasonable limits. And stop whining about the lead investigator, a non-expert boss being able to explain the work of his expert subordinates happens everywhere, media relations is usually part of his job description. \"\"The majority of the engineering community\"\": a few websites is not a majority, please show me a statement by an engineering society or so. But I wont stop them from doing research, if they write a report as thorough as NIST, I will be open for their ideas.\"\n",

You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:\n",

      " The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.\n",

      " This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example.

      " Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a \"\"human sacrifice\"\"; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's \"\"well\"\", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).\n",
      " I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.\n",
      " And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.\n",
      " BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.\n",
      " He gives people kittens. \"\"Kittens\"\" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.\n",
      " He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.\n",
      " He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of \"\"seeing a doctor/therapist\"\" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.\n",
      " He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.\n",

Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space.

Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user's anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard's \"\"unofficial source,\"\" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter.

And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (\"\"There have been a number of criticisms...\"\") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph's apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.\n",

      "If I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the '90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the '90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it.

But for some odd reason, their is little mention that Afghanistan has a ethnic and cultural connection with the history and culture of India? It doesn't make sense. I mean if it has all these ties that I have mentioned, doesn't that mean that Afghanistan has connections to the history and culture of India? I am not saying it was part of the country. Because in those days their were no boarders. But wasn't it apart of the local Aryan people? Before Islam werent many people Hindu and Buddhist then here water? So wouldn't it be easier to just say, that ancient Afghanistan has a connection to Ancient India?

      "Greek μυθολογια \"\"legend, storytelling\"\" is derived from μυθος \"\"speech, thought, story, myth\"\", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning \"\"an exposition of myths\"\". The current meaning of \"\"body of myths\"\" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of \"\"untrue story\"\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history.\"\" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the earliest known usage of \"\"myth\"\" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English \"\"fabulous\"\" doesn't mean \"\"wonderfully aesthetic\"\", it is the adjectival form of \"\"fable\"\", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term \"\"myth\"\" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things \"\"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.\"\".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define \"\"myth\"\" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.  (ውይይት) \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, a single-purpose account added \"\"mythology categories\"\" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of \"\"mythology\"\" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article \"\"Yoruba mythology\"\" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term \"\"mythology\"\" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from \"\"mythology\"\", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as \"\"mythology\"\".  That's simple common sense.

      "       He has devoted his life for the needy\n",
      "Not long ago Dr.I.K.Gill an expert in psychology and physical education came over to Pakistan from Germany. He held workshops in special education and physical education. Under the leadership of Dr.Gill workshops were held in Karachi as well as in Lahore. In Karachi workshops, teachers from special education institutes attended under his able leadership. Teachers from Punjab and North Frontier Province attended the similar courses in Lahore.\n",
      "Dr.I.K.Gill taught mental health and physical education for handicapped children. During these workshops he instructed the teachers how to teach children in physical movements so that they are able to lead their lives as normal human beings and they do not remain dependant on others.\n",
      "Dr.I.K.Gill originally comes from Pakistan. He was born 1924 in a village in Sialkot District. He was born in a poor home therefore he had to labour hard in the fields. However, he was keenly interested in acquiring education. He did his primary schooling in his own village and did his high school graduation at C.T.I. High School, Sialkot. After high school he joined the army and served his country in British India Government.  After release from the army he worked in Government College of Physical Education, Walton. Lahore as a superintendent and teacher.\n",
      "In 1956 he got a chance to go for higher studies in Germany in a college of physical education along with the university of  Cologne, Germany. After graduation from Germany, he went to the University of Graz, Austria for Ph.D. Having completed his PhD he went back to Germany and worked as a teacher of physical education. During his service he happened to see a photo in a church magazine, which alerted his life profoundly for ever. They were the images of people suffering from leprosy. The moment he saw a fellow countryman, he was shaken through and through. At that moment he decided to go to Pakistan. Within a short time by the Grace of God through the German Leprosy Relief Association he landed in Pakistan with his newly wedded wife.\n",
      "He started his work in Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Karachi (e.g.the Leprosy Colony in a hut behind McLeod Road, later a building was bought in Frere Road in Saddar Bazaar)\n",
      "From 1962 to 1970 Dr, Gill worked for the welfare of Leprosy patients in Pakistan. \n",
      "Dr. Gill said about his mission “I always wanted to know those unfortunate people who are dependant in one way or the other upon others. My ambition was to teach such people to be able to do their own work and lead an independent happy life. Such unfortunate people are victim of unhappiness and misery, therefore my yearning was to help and work for the welfare of such weaker sections of community. So I thought I must involve myself in a difficult mission. For such vital mission I chose to come to my own beloved country Pakistan”. Dr. Gill concentrated his special attention  on backward and handicapped children in Pakistan because  in his opinion today’s child is a responsible citizen, a child is tomorrow`s father being the builder and protector of the next generation. Therefore to educate him or her today is very important. Dr. Gill said that besides food and refuge is necessary for these children but undoubted education most important.  Dr. Gill revealed that he is very surprised to discover that parents of these unfortunate children have no ambition to educate these disadvantaged children. Today children are expected to contribute in the family income and expenditure. Let’s say that handicapped children cannot do so, but if they educated to look after their needs themselves and their person, they do not remain dependant upon others for the whole of their lives. Special education can make life easier and productive.\n",
      "TABIn view of his services from 1962 -70 Government of Pakistan invited Dr.I.K.Gill to Pakistan. He came back to train teachers of physical and special education, so that these teachers could provide special education to needy children in their respective areas. \n",
      "Dr. Gill provided this facility in Lahore, Islamabad, and Karachi. He stayed and carried on his services for about eight weeks to complete series of lectures.\n",
      "He also came back this year again to carry on series of special education training which took place in Lahore and Karachi. He appreciated greatly that three universities accepted the challenge and established the departments of special education. Dr. Gill trained forty teachers both in Lahore and Karachi who would further train teachers in special education. Therefore the number of teachers will be increased. \n",

      "{{unblock|reason=Block serves no purpose. Given that my so-called PAs were limited to AN/I, and that I am preparing a case for RfC/U then I am hardly likely to persist. Further to the point that remarks on AN/I that are not related to content disputes are not disruptive, and therefore the block is not preventative, as there are, and have been, no concerns regarding disruption or vandalise to encyclopedic articles. My argument stands that this block is a WP:COATRACK with my \"\"personal attacks\"\" being highlighted to mask the uncivil remarks and assertions on AN/I. Those assertions, based on undue lack of AGF, over my response to a WQA are based on straw man arguments, with no evidence to support the claims, and in fact run on a parallel track to the discussion at AN/I, but have in fact been misrepresented through synthesis to create an attack on my contribs, and cannot be reasonably analysed as a \"\"bad faith\"\" WQA response. However, this is the tone that has been used by an admin who refused to get involved in the WQA, but did not hesitate to question my ability to respond to the WQA, which was also, notably, my first WQA response, which was concluded and closed by supporting editors. Therefore the attack on my response, which was made prematurely, perhaps an uncivil approach in itself, was unfounded. Since the close, the admin has refused to recognise their critique as a bad faith attack, nor have they refactored it recognise the conclusion of the WQA. They have, instead, used my earlier uncivil remarks, which I should not pre-dated the AN/I topic by 3 days and therefore the admins right to question my WQA response was somewhat presumptious given that the two events are unrelated, and casting doubts on an editors ability to contribute to X-area of wiki because they had a dispute in Y-area of wiki is not a logical conclusion, it is a straw man argument; i.e. \"\"Because MB was uncivil to editor-A on AN/I, he should be kept away from WQA\"\". This flaw being, that every article, user, project and content page on wiki has a discussion page, therefore why not argue \"\"If MB is uncivil on AN/I, he could be uncivil anywhere\"\"? Having dismissed the admins argument as flawed, based in this discrepancy, plus the fact they were assuming I would respond to WQA, but it had been my first and there is no evidence to suggest I was going to make a career out of it, the admin drew conclusion based on a false premis. Those conclusions were used detrimentally and matter-of-fact, despite being opinions, theories and at most, concerns. At no time did the admin attempt to address those concerns on my talk page, as would be proper. Instead they made uncivil remarks, questioning the faith of my response and promoting a damning claim, using quotes out of context and lacking correct interpretation. I maintain that the intentions of the admin were uncivil, and that by addressing me \"\"potentially uncivil\"\" the admin was making proactive disdainful remarks, based on one solitary WQA, rather than a reactive proposal based on sufficient history, behaviour patterns or evidence to support the theory. To make matters worse, when I confronted the admin with this they adopted a defensive stance, dismissing my anger at their assertions as uncivil, and convoluted the matter further by placing my angry response above their own behaviour, whilst casting judgement, thus clouding the issue, i.e. the WP:COATRACK counter-measure. I consider this an attack on my integrity, as my response to WQA was rejected and questioned before it was even resolved, which is a clear example of attacking the faith of an editor. Because the admin continued to accelerate their case against me with condescending remarks, and refusal to accept their straw man claim as unreasonable or irrelevant to the discussion, i.e. a fork. Their persistence to use those comments can only be observed as advocating. For any admin of that experience to be unable to recognise their own bad faith, illogical attempt to predict an editor, and close-minded approach, there has to be a underlying motive, in my belief, for them to persist, to the degree of blocking me and refusing to allow their behaviour to be questioned is paramount to enacting COI.  So, though my responses may be considered uncivil, they are in reaction to what I perceive as irresponsible admin attitude, and pessimistic misuse of my response at WQA. That is not a PA, or uncivil, it is a legit observation with regards my POV which was made to look warped due to the late-interjection with straw man based propositions, casting aspersions on my ability to handle WQA. Unless there has been a direct complaint or issue pertaining to a page, or discussion, it is not appropriate for an admin to imply anything, and therefore my one-off role at WQA is\n",

      "hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments. I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information. The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here. There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain. The fact that a story is not accepted by \"\"mainstream\"\" academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions. What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (i.e. Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the \"\"mainstream\"\" view. Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy. Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons. For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia. This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different. Still it is dissapointing. Happy trails. Gregjay (talk) \n",

(I will double-check this) But her initial testimony to the FBI closely matches what she told the WC several months later. She later said that the photos were taken a bit later (not late Feb- early Mar 1963 as she told the FBI/WC, but late Mar/early Apr), which fits in with other evidence. Most importantly, she maintains to this day - even as she now thinks her husband was not responsible for the assassination - that she indeed took the photos. So this suggestion of \"\"government pressure\"\" to make her \"\"change her story\"\" doesn't add up. Why change her belief from \"\"he's guilty\"\" to \"\"he's innocent\"\" (which surely goes against what \"\"the government\"\" would want her to say), while sticking to her \"\"I took the photos\"\" claim?

It's really frustrating sometime when something is so obvious but it prevents more problems than it causes.  Keeping the main three shouldn't be an issue; the show runners have talked about the one-to-one comparison to their UK counterparts in interviews.  It's something I've been meaning to go looking for (the articles where they've talked about how they are similar and different from the originals) but haven't had a chance to do yet.

There's not going to be a lot out there yet because it's the first season but it'll be awesome if we can start getting the article overhauled with this kind of stuff right away.  I follow the UK version's article and a few other list of character articles that have been going on for years with just updates to plot summary and no real world stuff.

Sometimes when you are closely working with somebody you neglect to reward them for things that are really, really great. During my time on Wikipedia, I have seen you grow from a contributor who makes edits every now and then - almost solely contributing to Aquinas College, Perth to a wide PSA school scope. Recently I have stopped my contributions to PSA articles, for reasons both you and I know. I have realised my thank yous over the year you and I have been working together for have culminated in something a little larger. By comparison, you have probably been the editor I have worked with the most. I look forward to working with you in the future. Until then, here's a barnstar in recognition of your efforts in Australian schools articles. Soon enough, I hope to be joining your PSA watch you emailed me about. Thanks again, Auroranorth \"\n",

      "Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.\n",
      "Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term \"\"cervical cap\"\" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term \"\"cervical cap\"\" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only \"\"cervical cap\"\").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term \"\"cervical cap\"\" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.\n",
      "Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.\n",
      "Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so \"\"cervical cap\"\" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.\n",

A crap load of promos and about 20 minutes of wrestling. Though last week's episode was very good. TNA are trying to raise the bar with Samoa Joe's new gimmick in which he gets himself DQed then beat the living hell out of the guy. Last week he hung a guy upside down by his feet and beat him like a pinata with a kendo stick. It was funny and great. Most hate it, since it is controversial, but I loved it. They need to raise the bar. Check it out if you want. They have a few good things going now but at the moment WWE are doing better. Hopefully after the storyline involving The Main Event Mafia and The Front Line in over, they'll go back to their old ways. Sting is supposed to retire this year. Angle might head back to WWE. If that is the case, then we'll get new blood in the main event.

      " That sounds almost like the Tibetan government-in-exile's claim that \"\"violence to a Tibetan is killing someone; if you don't kill them, and only beat them up, and they run away, it's not violence\"\" (I'm paraphrasing, but the exact quote is in 2008 Tibetan unrest.)  but you'd probably resent that comparison.\n",
      " Let's try an almost exact analogy: \"\"The robbery victim should have just divvied up all the cash to the robber. If she'd just let go, there wouldn't have been any violence\"\". Or: \"\"Britain should have just surrendered. If they had just let go of their country, there wouldn't have been a war\"\". What's wrong is wrong is wrong. A person has the right to defend their person and legally obtained possession, and you can't justify crime (not including political crimes) or violence against a civilian by a political cause. \n",
      " Yes, the flame attendants themselves are idiots, too, and they are \"\"thugs\"\" when they are pushing the British olympic chief.

Whether we're looking at these things as rings or lattices or fragments of formal logic or whatever is the wrong question. The right question is: who is the audience? And the answer is: there is more than one of them. At least as the current US college system is set up, many beginning computer science students need an article like Boolean algebra (logic) or Boolean logic, and would be baffled and lost by the mathematical formalism in Boolean algebra (structure). On the other hand, mathematicians from the advanced undergraduate level upwards would find those articles simplistic and useless, and need instead something like Boolean algebra (structure) or Boolean algebras canonically defined. We don't have to hide the fact that they're all really the same thing, but I think trying to make the freshman computer scientists learn ring theory in order to look up de Morgan's laws, or trying to make the math majors wade through lots of truth tables, would be a bad idea in either case.  And I think that trying to please both audiences in a single article would lead to a mess that's even worse than the current mess in Boolean logic. So, please do consider some merges — we have too many articles — but please don't take your one unified theory and insist that it's the only way the subject can be presented. —\n",

The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with \"\"approve & oppose\"\". The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write \"\"weak approve\"\" or \"\"strong approve\"\" when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using \"\"violence\"\".

      "The large numbers of Korean refugees crowding the Yongdong area undoubtedly helped the enemy infiltrate the 1st Cavalry Division positions. On 24 July, for example, a man dressed in white carrying a heavy pack, and accompanied by a woman appearing to be pregnant, came under suspicion. The couple was searched and the woman's assumed pregnancy proved to be a small radio hidden under her clothes. She used this radio for reporting American positions. Eighth Army tried to control the refugee movement through the Korean police, permitting it only during daylight hours and along predetermined routes.\n",

      "In the meantime, and pursuant to General Walker's order on the 11th, Colonel Murch's 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry, had been engaged in helping to clear the enemy from the area south of Yongsan. On the 11th Murch's battalion departed from its assembly area near Masan and rolled north toward the Naktong River. A steady stream of Korean refugees clogged the road. As the battalion pushed its way through this traffic a refugee cart overturned, exposing about fifteen rifles and several bags of ammunition. Approximately twelve North Korean soldiers disguised as refugees accompanying it fled across an open field.\n",

      "Hello FlugKerl.  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven.  It is great article and well-sourced.  I have just done a little copy-editing.  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft \"\"produced each year in North America exceeds ... \"\" and compares it with \"\"all commercial general aviation companies.\"\"  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about \"\"all commercial general aviation companies\"\" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:\n",

      "Yes there may well be a small number of law firm articles which do not have a complete list of offices, but the overwhelming majority do, as you will have no doubt have discovered yourself in your search. I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.\n",
      "\n",
      " My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. \n",
      "\n",
      " The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.\n",
      "\n",
      " Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.\n",

I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.\n",
      "\n",
      " I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles. I have no particular problem with this, but wonder why law firms in general, and this law firm in particular, are being singled out for so much harsher treatment here.\n",

      "Candy day will be celebrated throughout the United States on Saturday next. The Confectioners' and Ice Cream Manufacturers' Protective Association announced yesterday that it has completed plans for popularizing the day in New York. There are about 1,800 candy stores in this city, and about 550 are members of the association and manufacture most of the candy they sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every one of the members' stores special displays will be arranged, and each customer will receive souvenirs, E. A. G. Intemann Jr., President of the association said. Pa, Ma, and the kiddies will all be supplied with a piece of home-made candy, mostly in the form of peppermint sticks. There has been so much interest manifest among confectioners and such enthusiasm over candy day that the association has offered prizes for the best display of candy manufactured on the premises and for the most artistic piece of candy manufactured. Mr. Intemann said that the candy entered in the competition would, in his opinion, be masterpieces of the candymaking art.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Let Candy Day be a time when everyone feels young again,\"\" he said. \"\"Everybody likes candy, and we all want to make the day one of happiness for all; a day to bring back the memory of the time when a pilgrimage to the candy store for a stick of peppermint or a hunk of molasses taffy was an event to be looked forward to. I recall even now the childish pleasure I derived from a visit to the little store in our block and the pride with which I returned home attached to a stick of candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"I met a man the other day who said when he heard of Candy Day that it recalled just those things to his mind, and he started out to see whether he could still find the particular kind of candy that used to delight him. He did, and so it is not so very far-fetched to say that Candy Day will revive our youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"The association wants to see Candy Day firmly established, and the public can rest assured that, so far as this organization is concerned, the day will not be made an excuse for gouging. Prices will remain the same as on every other day. What we do want, however, is to see every man, woman and child enjoy candy on next Saturday.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Candy Day was instituted in 1915, the confectioners made no effort to celebrate it. This was because of the war, and later because of the sugar situation. Saturday, Mr. Intemann says, will be New York's first real Candy Day.\n",

      " One Buzzfeed article has suggested that this accolade has since been surpassed by Desperate Housewives. However, this claim has not appeared in any other mainstream publication and it has not been discussed by cast or crew of either series. While several of the main cast members of Desperate Housewives are female, two male actors, James Denton and Ricardo Antonio Chavira, have appeared in every episode of the series. In the title credits, the mixed-gender cast is credited together; in the first season, the series is billed as 'Starring Terri Hatcher', [et al], Steven Culp, Ricardo Antonio Chavira, [...] and James Denton'. By contrast, only female cast members, Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, have appeared in every episode of Charmed and have been credited as main cast members in every series. The introductory credits bill the series as 'Starring Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, and Alyssa Milano' (for seasons 1-3) or as 'Starring Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as \"\"Piper\"\"' (seasons 4-8), followed by supporting and guest actors. While several published monographs, including the Handbook to Life in America by Rodney P. Carlisle (Rutgers University) and the Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, have analysed Charmed as 'the longest-running show in history featuring female leads', no reference to this accolade in relation to Desperate Housewives has ever appeared in print. Aaron Spelling, Brad Kern, and the cast members, Milano, McGowan, and Combs, have all publicly recognized and discussed the accolade.\n",

      "Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute\n",
      "    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people and also people often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also used the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as \"\"S\"\" shapes standing for its \"\"Socialism\"\" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa\n",

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: \"\"Do no harm.\"\" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.\n",

      "I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:\n",
      "\n",
      ">The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<\n",
      "\n",
      "Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:\n",
      "\n",
      "http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html\n",
      "\n",
      "Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents. Nina Green\n",

I do not disparage AFL because it is a part of Australian culture, I disparage because it is not part of my Australian culture up north and that whole reference is dodgy.

      "\"It is precisely because Presley is singled out for such criticism that it should be mentioned. Well that is your opinion. I would go a different way: The famous musicians (or their fans) who accused him should show their sources (they have the advantage of being alive and are able to defend themselves against accusations). It would make more sence to me to write about the obvious racism of Chuck D and Mary Blidge and a lot of other famous people than about Elvis' non-exixting racism. I think it's is unfair to the music and cultural impact of Elvis that such things got too much space in the article and other much more essential aspects of Elvis did not get mentioned. I think people who are interested in the person and music of Mary Blidge or Chuck D should discuss it on the discussion site of their articles in wikipedia. They should find out if there is racism or not. Or maybe start an article \"\"racism in showbussiness\"\" and dicuss it there. I think you should not let  it become your problem that some people (for instance Chuck D and Blidge obviously) have problems with 1.Elvis being white , 2.the fact that he was from the rural south, 3.that they believe what other people say only because they share a similar pigmentation and repeat it without checking out any sources or 4.that they wanted get simply attention. By the way - Do you think this musicians ever heard one of  A. Crudup's or Kokomo Arnold's songs or even Roy Brown? I think you could write that Elvis was target of racism and accused of being a racist and mentioning some source and footnotes. But for an article about Elvis it is too detailed the way it is. I think give Elvis credit for what he did - positive and negative - and not for what he did not do.\n",

He meant much more to them than the other way around (positive or negative). I only gave details about the meeting I've read in a german book which proably was not published in english language. It shows a very negative behavior of Elvis and I wished he would have act different but the sources are that way and having the Beatles Anthology on dvd I could see and hear  Ringo Starr telling the story (only McCartney was very, very kind, maybe even a little bit white washing).\n",

Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some \"\"real Arab\"\" from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of \"\"al-Qushayri\"\" roots is unverifiable.  The most authoritative of the Hadiths is al-Bukhari (from the city of Bukhara).

      "A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy \"\"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships\"\" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.\n",

      "I’ll propose below, for comment, a couple of alternative ways to proceed to fix No Gun Ri Massacre. But first ….\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent interest shown by ,  and, now,  presents a real opportunity to improve the article and bring it back to high WP standards. In the past couple of years, new sources have been published and there have been new developments, including a more settled estimate of the dead from South Korean authorities. They belong in the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it will be a demanding task; there’s a hell of a lot wrong here. And, most of all, to fall back on a cliché, it’s essential not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. One big “forest,” clearly, is the way-out-of-line behavior of WeldNeck, not just at No Gun Ri Massacre, but Wikipedia-wide, as evidenced by the repeated warnings from other contributors, including many he simply deleted from his Talk page, as with ’s edit-warring warning at [], and including ’s observation [] that he has engaged in “POV pushing on all the articles you have edited.” As said, one must go back in his Talk history to find the thousands of illicitly deleted bytes. Then recall his outrageous action of just two days ago, killing my posting here at NGR Talk, and his taunting “have fun with this” when he posted his frivolous bid for a topic ban at ANI. When you combine all this with his dozens and dozens of rapid-fire, unjustified, unexplained reverts at No Gun Ri Massacre, I think it should be clear this is a guy who cannot be trusted on anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “trees,” the distractions, are the red herrings that WeldNeck and other denialists wave on No Gun Ri. (Before WeldNeck, there was an NGR denialist going by \"\"Kauffner\"\" who got banned for general mayhem around WP.) The denialists arose in the year 2000, grasping at anything to attack those whose research work exposed No Gun Ri and thereby made the U.S. Army look less than saintly. One of their problems, along with their blinding anger and their obtuseness about so many things, is that they’re stuck in the year 2000. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, after long investigations, the South Korean and U.S. governments confirmed that the U.S. military killed the trapped refugees at NGR “by the effects of small-arms fire, artillery and mortar fire, and strafing”; it emerged that more than a dozen military documents showing orders to shoot civilians were suppressed in the U.S. investigation; a Harvard historian reported (in 2005) the discovery of a U.S. ambassadorial letter to the State Department warning, on the day the NGR killings began, that the Army had decided to shoot approaching South Korean refugees (another suppressed document); other media organizations, including the BBC, replicated and then advanced the NGR story beyond the original reporting; a government committee led by South Korea’s prime minister certified a minimal death toll, with identified victims; and the government built a large memorial park and museum at the site where the facts of NGR are enshrined in exhibits and informational material, and where a new, consensus death toll is accepted. This is the “forest” to keep in mind.\n",

A possible solution: I’ll compare my two lengthy lists of problems (from late 2013 and late 2014) and update them into one that lists problems that still exist. And Mr. Wood or others could then work from that. That might take me one day to prepare.\n",

Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. \n",

There is a big diference between \"\"imitation\"\" and \"\"influence\"\". Raphael was influenced by Michelangelo and Michelangelo was influenced by Signorelli (by his own words) and there is no sense to state about \"\"shameless imitations\"\" at all. Now, about Parmigianino and Pontormo being influenced by Last Judgement and Capella Paolina frescoes - I only pointed out obvious fact - Parmigianino was already dead by the time Michelangelo finished LJ and started Paolina frescoes and as I knew Pontormo never was in Rome at the time and later. Probably those things comes from Kenney Mencher online lectures, filled with timeline errors. He even thinks Correggio (d. 1534) was influenced by LJ, which is bizarre.

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",

Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",

She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",

The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",

She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

      "My apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above. I have re-read it and can still find none. You \"\"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study\"\", while I believe that \"\"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead\"\". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.\n",
      "As to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.\n",
      "On the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.\n",
      "More directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a \"\"star polygon\"\", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a \"\"simple polygon\"\". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as \"\"simple\"\" or \"\"convex\"\" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person's preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.\n",

In the 1980's, I personally interviewed a former worker in his computer center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and heard about the highly questionable fund-raising methods employed.  That former worker told me that Humbard used \"\"scare tactics\"\" to get viewers, especially elderly viewers, to send in money.  The main ploy was to send out many mass mailings and claim that his program would go off the air unless the viewers sent in a lot of money.  The former computer center employee told me that Humbard told viewers in these mass mailings that \"\"the government\"\" was trying to shut him down.  Also, the former employee told me that the Canadian government was so concerned about the mailings and calls to elderly viewers in Canada that Humbard was banned from mailing any promotion materials to Canada. Humbard's computer system was state-of-the-art, as was his TV studio equipment.  An IBM engineer told me that Humbard had the newest and one of the best IBM mainframe computer systems in Ohio.  A former engineer at WJW TV 8 in Cleveland told me that Humbard had, at least for a few years, the most expensive and sophisticated television production equipment in the Cleveland area.

The revolving restaurant idea stirred a lot of controversy.  The concrete tower to support the restaurant was over 400 feet tall and the FAA was against the construction due to airline flight paths into Hopkins International airport.

Their abuse of sources shows their willingness to subscribe to editing and rules, in the face of facts and researched knowledge. They are pedantic and callous, and I unfortunately have joined them at their own level; I must now re-elevate myself and return to the dictates of logic and critical thinking, something that my experience on Wikipedia has deluted. I will return to my original research and take the experience of Wikipedia as a lesson; that no matter how much experience and involvement a person has on a particular subject, there are always those who no nothing, willing to reduce your efforts to elevate their own egos and ambitions. I will take away all my contributions. I realize they will be re-inserted for the Yahoos benefit, but that will be out of my hands!

The problem comes in that Wikipedia, as an encyclopedia (and I will call this site on that again and again), grants a statement of \"\"fact\"\" on something which is now fiction, because the public has decided that the event, since it physically took place, cannot be reversed, even if all evidence points to the fact that it should've been.\n",

It is titled, \"\"The Discovery of the Bismarck\"\" by Robert D. Ballard, who is an authoritative figure on the subject of the German battleship, Bismark, since he was part of the crew that rediscovered the sunken wreck in 1988 and has already written another book already referenced in this article. The book contains an in depth history of the ship Bismarck, from different historical perspectives from all the ships involved in it's sinking, as well as documentation on the methodology and events of the ship that discovered the wreck. 198.189.57.4  \"\n",

It was an extremely unpleasant and tortuous experience that involved neutral and \"\"pro-Obama\"\" editors bending over backwards to accommodate 3 anti-Obama editors who wanted to make a as big a deal as possible out of Wright's ravings. The \"\"negotiation\"\" took weeks to accomplish, even with the timely assistance of an impartial and thoughtful administrator. Kossack is trying to restore this particular version, but he has embellished it with provocative sub-headings, and enhanced it by conflating it with Ayers-related BS. What he fails to understand is that the Wright controversy has now passed into history, and is no longer significant. It had no overall effect on the primaries, and Republican attempts to use it in a recent special election backfired. Therefore, an abbreviated summary is all that is now needed, and curious historians can read all the gory details in the exhaustive sub article and the related biography - as I mentioned earlier.    \n",

Surely a slap in the face and the academic equivalent of same are two entirely different things.  One is a physical assault and highly illegal.  The other is not.  Do you agree?

I can't make heads or tails of all these Americans and their strange denominations, and I ran into this club, which appears to be affiliated with the \"\"regular\"\" Anglican church, but presumably with a difference.

But there's also churches in South America, and plenty of missionary activity (see this), which is hard to do, I guess, from Luverne... Anyway, I can't figure out exactly what they are. Google Books has little to offer (and I don't have access to the Encyclopedia of American religions), another suggestion of smallness. What I want to do is write the article for Michael Simmons, the archbishop (but archbishop of what?), but maybe you can help me write the article for the ACA along the way. Thanks in advance for whatever you can do for me. Oh, I'm going to ask another editor from the Anglican project as well; I hope you don't mind that I'll point the here, so I don't have to copy and paste, which would really hurt my reputation for originality.

The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important \"\"Components of Fitness\"\". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, \"\"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max\"\", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name \"\"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness\"\".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference\n",

To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15\n",

However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia.

In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums.

Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.\n",

      "We are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN.
