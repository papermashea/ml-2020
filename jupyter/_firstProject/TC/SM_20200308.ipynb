      "First off, we are not discussing 2015, we are discussing 2016; that much should be obvious. Second, the fact that we've always done things a certain way does not erase the possibility of improving our process. I would argue, and I'd hope you would agree, that these articles have only gotten better over time. That improvement did not happen because we sat on our hands and were content with the level of quality we had already reached. Third, I do not think Lotus/Renault and Marussia/Manor are relevant situations to each other. With Lotus, we know the Renault takeover is going to be done, and we know the name will be changed. Both have been confirmed. With Marussia, as F1 fans we know the name was only kept to keep their FOM TV rights money, and we have every reason to believe it will be changed now that Marussia is entirely out of the picture, but that's nonetheless original research that isn't fit for this article. I now agree that I was wrong to fight for the Renault name, but Lotus is equally wrong. We have no specific confirmation of the former, but we do have confirmation that it won't be the latter. So what we know for sure is very little - in fact, I believe all we know is the drivers and the engine. That that's why it should say TBA-Lotus. Additionally, think of it from this perspective: a person reads a news article announcing that the Renault takeover has been completed. They read another story from the head of Renault Sport indicating the Lotus team name will be dropped. These articles are from reliable sources and feature direct quotes. They then come here and see...Lotus. Their only reaction is going to be that Wikipedia is clearly wrong. And they're right to think that. And if you DON'T agree that reliably reported quotes from the head of organizations are good enough sources for Wikipedia, then there's quite a lot that needs to be removed from this article. You can't have it both ways.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'll ask one more time, very, very seriously:  Can anyone cite a reliable written source which definitively says how the NVIDIA muckamucks intend for \"\"NVIDIA\"\" to be pronounced?  For some time now, the article said /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/, but someone changed it just now to say /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said several months ago (see Talk:Nvidia#The way it's meant to be pronounced? above), I am, personally, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that NVIDIA's own pronunciation of its name (based on the audio of the animated logo at the start of a recent game) is /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (\"\"inn-VID-ee-uh\"\", with the first two vowels being identical).  I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (\"\"en-VID-ee-uh\"\"), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the \"\"pin-pen merger\"\" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore \"\"hear\"\" the pronunciation differently from some other people.  Or, perhaps the person whose voice was recorded for the NVIDIA animated logo happens to speak a regional dialect with the pin-pen merger, and none of the NVIDIA execs have noticed or cared.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first impulse, just now, was to simply revert the latest edit and put the text back the way it was before (/ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/).  My second impulse was to leave it as it now is, but put a {{fact}} tag on the pronunciation until someone can supply a reliable source.  But if no one can come up with a source, I believe it's better not to give any pronunciation until/unless it can be reliably sourced.    \"\n",

I think the distinction is between a 7 main bearing six and a 4 main bearing six, in that the former gets crankshaft whip under control and gives you more potential for high-end horsepower, which you can exploit with an easily added overhead cam or two. However, the general gist is that the American manufacturers went off down a technological blind alley with the big pushrod V8s and got sucker-punched by the fuel crisis, while BMW, Mercedes, and the Japanese managed to crank out as much power from more fuel-efficient overhead cam straight sixes. There's probably a better way to put it. The point is probably moot now that V6s have taken over the market, but American manufacturers are still off down a blind alley with the big OHV gas guzzlers.\n",

There are many little things in the article that were written from a lay perspective of those who have read a bit about homeopathy and think that they know a lot, and unless those are repaired there is no reason to remove the tag. Besides, it is reasonable to have this tag on indefinitely due to the wide disagreement on the topic. This is not a bad thing as one thing can be stated with certainty: that the issue of homeopathy is not as simple as it looks, so each reader will need both critical faculties and research time to make sense of it. 1 July 2005 14:28 (UTC)\"\n",

The bid to change that - and introduce different formats with separate flag icons and name-links for China and Taiwan and also full-form names for the two of them - was, reasonably enough (and entirely correctly in my view), reverted. Rather than their trying to justify the change brefore reintroducing it, we then had various people edit warring the change, or variations of it, back in, often using bizarre edit summaries referring to Israel, WP not being ISO etc. I will restore the stable, prior, internally consistent version (I see it's just been changed yet again) and then perhaps can those obsessed with changing such a minor, trivial point put their case here first, before messing with it again?

      "There are plenty of sources which are not age old and I have provided them before considering I used to take part in actual discussion on discussion pages until DIREKTOR would then find a way to limit that discussion in that the discussion page is 'not a forum'. He is against any academic progress and democracy in general. Stating such is; of course, an attack on his character even though he openly worships communist totalitarian regimes here on wikipedia and communist totalitarian dictatorships and dictators. Even when there is vast consensus against him, since he is paid to be here, he knows every possible way to limit such exposure and simply logs complaints against the opposition until they are completely outlawed and banned. Typically this type of behavior is traditional in communist totalitarian dictatorships. My comment was of course a legitimate content comment as all content is monitored and approved by DIREKTOR and his lobby group here on wikipedia. Unless you have something negative to add - don't add it at all because he will have it removed. This is because this topic in itself is still political in modern day Croatia where any type of objective historical discussion is branded as communist revisionism as outlined by one Dr. Ante Birin at the Croatian Historic Institute who recently held a great discussion on the matter. I would like to point out that the user DIREKTOR has directly linked me to 'nazism' - even though anyone with half a brain knows that German National Socialism is not the same as Croatian Ustasism - but of course, that is not an attack on my personal character. I have not been blocked for any relevant reason other than the fact that I oppose DIREKTORs nonacademic claim to all WW2 Croatia-related articles. Some of my statements were in hope that someone would notice his bias which is the biggest elephant I have ever seen standing in a room ever. Regarding Dr. Pavelic's nationality - Pavelic did not believe in Yugoslavism, he was a self-declared anti-yugoslav and on many occasions publicly -and in written form - argued the idiotic basis of such a movement. But of course it only makes sense to have Pavelic be a Yugoslav so that tito can be considered a Croat in DIREKTORs logical political platform here on wikipedia. Thank you.\n",

      "“Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” This is a claim of consensus claim. I see no source which is defining a consensus. What these sources are saying is their own view only. A source defining a consensus would be saying something like “Most people think Kurmis are S*****”. There is no such source. Besides that, the sentence in the article is immensely confusing. It does not spell out who regards Kurmis as S*****. That should be clear. Who? Indians? Certinly not. Martians? Are you serious? Americans? Most of them won’t happen to know what is “Kurmi”. Who else? Academics? Where do we have a source saying that? Showing ten sources that talk about Kurmis as S***** and concluding on our own that they are generally regarded as X won’t do. That is synthesis/OR. Then we have to guard against cherry picking too (as Nameisnotimportant has been indicating)(cherry picking is one of the major pitfalls of using GBooks). Even if we do find a non cherry picked clear statement, we will have to see if the statement is encyclopedic enough. That would mean, we need to find the same statement in another encyclopedia to say the same thing in the same way, i.e. near the top of the article. I don’t really think this can be done by these sources (or any other sources). IMO the statement is best scrapped and replaced by something like “Recognition:Recognized by GOI as OBC”. It makes no sense to say “Claim Kshatriya status, but generally recognised as Shudra” because they are not S*****. ASAT. I am glad that we now have some fresh users on the talk page and agree that their presence and their suggestions have helped let the discussion take a positive and meaningful turn. We have quotes on the page now, some degree of  willingness to discuss things in a meaningful manner. As I have been saying, if we want to keep the present sentence, we have to come up with a clear, non cherry picked, encyclopedic quote defining a consensus. We don’t have it IMO. There may be other considerations too, and I may bring them up if necessary. I would suggest that the sentence be changed.-\n",

      "Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.  \n",

      "Personally I think the entire discussion of formulas is out of place in the Standardization section.  See the entry on Microsoft Office Open XML for an example of what is a better writeup, IMHO.  Keep the Standardization section to the basics of what, when and where, the type of summary info that should be upfront and easily found in an encylopedia entry.  Put the debates or other side issues in their own section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, a comment by a member of OASIS does not necessarily reflect OASIS policy or even the majority view of the ODF TC.  It is just one person's opinions at one point in time.  The use of the word \"\"rushed\"\" needs to be subtantiated, otherwise it is merely opinion.  Since I can also point to opinions on the web that say that ODF was not rushed, I think we'll both need to acknowledge that this is a debatable point, and either both sides of the argument should be presented, or an unadorned statement of the facts presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to state the facts, we could mentioned when the ODF specification started standardization (December 2002), when comments on the lack of spreadsheet formulas were brought up (February 2005) and when the OASIS standard was issued (May 2005).  Was this a sign of rushing?  Or was it merely the case that it was too late in the ODF 1.0 process to take on this additional work?  It is certainly possible for the later to be true without the former.  2+ years for a standard is not typically evidence of rushing.\n",

Also, the ones currently on Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus (made by some other guy... not DINOguy, let alone DinoGuy2) have a weird scale... on *D* each grid square is .6m on each side, and on *T* they are .9m on each side. Seems like it would make more sense to be a square meter like you have. Plus they have a comma instead of a period, which no English-speaking country uses (this is English Wikipedia after all). So I guess if you have time, could you do those too? I would do them but I'm not sure how you get the outlines you use... do you draw them yourself or are they clipart from somewhere?

The history shows that from August through November (4 months) the article was protected because the user SantiLak repeatedly vandalized the article.  The edit history, also shows that SantiLak reverted the article without any discussion whatsoever four times within 24 hours. He was warned previously by an Admin, but just took the warning off his Talk page and continued the pattern. Yesterday, the pattern continued.  I was merely attempting to keep the material from being deleted again without discussion.  If you find me in violation, I respect that. But at least, hold SantiLak to account as well because the history clearly shows he reverted 4 times in 24 hours, causing the article to go into protected status.  It’s up to you.  Whatever you decide, have a great day there’s nothing personal about this for me.  I just hope an article about a public entity does not get stripped to the point where it become little more than an advertising brochure bereft of noted criticism of that entity by the courts, mainstream news sources, and even former employees.

I have written a little along these lines and I would appreciate it if you would leave it as it is. You'll find that the comments I made are not disparagaring and are simply there to make the point. My comments are justified, as a quick comparison between my and Kung Fu Man's replies will show how he frequently posts in an un-called for antagonistic manner. \n",

You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia:\n",
      "\n",
      " The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well.\n",

Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally \"\"forcedmemefred\"\" is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment.\n",
      " Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a \"\"human sacrifice\"\"; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's \"\"well\"\", meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that, any increase in their medication dose will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred).\n",
      " I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did.\n",
      " And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with.\n",
      " BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet.\n",
      " He gives people kittens. \"\"Kittens\"\" may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens.\n",
      " He has the reputation of distorting people's histories.\n",
      " He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of \"\"seeing a doctor/therapist\"\" advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers.\n",
      " He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people.\n",

      "____Interesting discussions here although we all have to admin that their is lack of sources most of the sources we have are non-english. If anybody want indian I sure can provide hindi sources which all of confirms the ghuri kingdom to be Pathans. Because they were major player in history of india. I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti's mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim \"\"invaders\"\".\n",
      " Also talk The Iranica's is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name \"\" Wišnasp\"\" and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don't see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. \n",
      "The most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem? \n",

A large portion of the naval history books I have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing, and if you're lucky you'll find books which quote documents verbatim.

Already I have seen where certain historians (Gordon in The Rules of the Game is one) have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers, and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different.\n",

      "Thank you Gwen for re-stating my reply to Jdlund. I also complied with your previous block. As to Jimbo Wales and his claims of \"\"years of disruption on this article\"\", those are his opinions, however, 70% of the facts in the article are based on my contributions, including my photos of the tower (before the university corrupted the tower with it's cages and remodeling the interior to something way beyond what it looked like at the time of the tragedy. Paint, cages and other cover-ups can not remove the actual history. Sure there have been previous wars over the content. I have been involved for over thirteen years getting the documents, interviews and real history of the tragedy, while trying to correct the media's versions, which are full of errors and out right misinformation. If some of the articles on the net and in the history of the media were used, Houston McCoy would be \"\"George McCoy\"\", Whitman would be the Devil or evil (read Gary Lavergne's \"\"Why Did He Do IT\"\" on his website (this is the author of \"\"A Sniper In The Tower\"\", who claimed the tower tragedy was the \"\"Worst Mass Murder In American History\"\", which I fought and proved that Andrew Kehoe was the worst until Whitman). Also, in Lavergne's article, he claims Whitman would be alive as of August 1, 2006, if the Supreme Court had not banned the death penalty a few years after the tragedy, even though Whitman had a Glioblastoma Grade IV brain tumor that would have killed him within a year - even if he had not gone up in the tower. All Jimbo Wales has ever done is react to the protests and misguided rule benders like BZUK and Gavia immer, who know nothing about the tragedy or the rules of a valid contribution. They (Gavia and BZUK), are just like Wales, memes who have no knowledge of what they are doing, just applying their own personal bias' for what they blindly consider acts of vandalism, with no proof, and not even looking at the contribution and it's sourcing. Again, I have made valid contributions that even Gwen admitted would be appropriate if re-written by a more neutral editor, but what doe that mean really? 98.94.132.166  \"\n",

      "I've been away on other things, and haven't got to starting the Alternate Theories section yet.  (Nothing mysterious has happened to me! ;)  I think it is safe to start on a foreknowledge section, and a dissenting government officials section.  I did look at what it was saying about that one Bin Laden tape on 9/11 myths.com, and admit that when you see the whole tape, some shots look considerably more like Bin Ladin than others.  The bit about the ring, when Islam prohibits it is still out of place.   That guy laughs a lot, too.  Bin Laden doesn't seem to be the kind who has a good sense of humor, but it did seem a more informal situation.  Still, the video is darker and has poor resolution, so that may account for some of the difficulty.  I downloaded a low-resolution video from cnn.com of the second plane hitting the tower, and there is a red spot off-center from the plane just before it strikes, similar to those in Loose Change, but I guess I need to quit being cheap and just order some of the documentaries to get better resolution.  I've read about half of a page on Able Danger somebody pointed out to me above, and it is interesting.  This may not be quick, but as it is a minority view, we won't be able to get into much depth here anyway.  Thanks for helping guard the Wikipedia content, BTW, guys.

Radiocarbon dates from the Roger's Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).\n",

      "[page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.\n",

The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan's 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.

      "  Moment of Joy! What brought me to Wikipedia was the lack of information in the article of Meera. In mid-April 2012, after spending nearly 3 and a half months, I planned to add to those article which are seldom edited by others. Those included the Nawabs of Bengal & Murshidabad, articles related to it and soap opera articles. Soap operas are ongoing so I have to edit them daily but the article on the Nawabs is a piece of history...and I took up the work alone. Later, in May some editors helped me to fix typos and grammatical errors, but soon withdrew back their help. But, by God's grace I finished with the work today on 4 August 2012 and would love to share this success with you! My condition was same as the flying man in the pic, trying to catch a several things at the same time before it's too late. I don't know whether he succeeds or not, bu I did succeed! However, I still have to add some references and summarize the plots of soap opera articles in the soap opera articles. If you want, then you can help.

Not only do they not belong on wikipedia, but as a student of logic, it is a classic logical fallacy to use an ad hominem remark to form an argument.

A claim of hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, it's a statement that one's views are contradictory, that proposes one standard for one case, and another standard for another. As such hypocrisy is not an ad hominem remark, rather it is used to describe inconsistent statements or behaviour.\n",

      "For example, you mention that \"\"You have to show me where the statistics of historians’ opinions about Hiroshima and Nagasaki decision is. Does it include Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab, Indian historians? Or only include U.S. Army historians? Even in that case, opinion of the majority is still OPINION, not fact.\"\" Fair enough, but later on you say \"\"it's been stated many times that the Americans were only thinking of saving American lives through the A-Bomb. The Japanese never came into it. They did not care at all about Japanese lives, so your reasoning is invalid.\"\" Who said this? You impose such high criteria for my statement that the A-Bomb saved human lives, requiring experts from all over the world, but soon after you baldly assert that my reasoning is invalid because \"\"it's been stated many times...\"\" Stated many times by who? According to your very own criteria, you need to provide evidence from Soviet historians, Japanese historians, Chinese historians, South American historians, East and West European historians, Africans historians, Arab and Indian historians. But you don't. You merely state \"\"it's been stated many times...therefore my reasoning is invalid.\"\" Apparently Loomis has to provide sources, but we can take Federico's word for it whatever he says. That, my dear friend, is hypocrisy. And you, my dear friend, are a hypocrite for reasoning in such a way. Calling you a hypocrite is therefore not an ad hominem remark and I therefore will not remove it.\n",

MSF (Microsoft Flight) does in fact contain every bit of a \"\"real\"\" flight sim (except its way more realistic, environmentally), but you don't have to. That's the whole and entire arguement. Many old time players heard that anyone could simply fly with a mouse and they lost their minds. But you can turn that all off, the automatic stuff. It will allow you the complete flight simulator experience of MSFS (Microsoft Flight Simulator and other sims), except not everyone will have to do it like that, and the weather (fog, clouds, light, shadow, etc) will be much more realistic. Take a look at that cockpit view of the Maule, all those buttons, switches, knobs, pedals can be used, all of it. The complete control is there; only some kid or grandma might be using their mouses and have all of that stuff being done for them by the computer. And they, the fanboys  errr  I mean the serious aircraft simulators, hate that so very much. Go to any flight sim forum and read all the rage, it's insane.

You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply \"\"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"\". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.\n",

      "Hi, RyanGerbil10.  Thank you for explaining the block placed on my account.  I have reviewed both WP:stalk and WP:NPA policies and I do not believe the actions you speak of are in violation of either of these policies, nor do I think that they warrant a 24h block (not even a warning).  Can you please clarify both the violation and why you felt that a 1-day block was appropriate?  Specifically, I'm not sure if you noticed, but I only edited two user pages - hardly \"\"following users around,\"\" so you say, and definitely NOT stalking.  I also responded whenever Aeon1006 was talking about me specifically, which every user probably has a prima facie right to do.  Finally, where was the personal attack on Aeon?  I merely stated my case and I think I provided ample support.  I would think that all of these things would barely warrant a warning, let alone a block of such duration.  I understand that you have been previously acquainted with Aeon1006 - I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind asking a second administrator to review this ruling if you don't think that you can be 100% impartial. Thank you very much for your consideration.  \"\n",

The standard I follow is simply to work with other editors to make each article a little better than we found it.

Doing so is highly relevant to the article it affects and belongs in the discussion of that article.\n",
      "I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.  It's all within the rules of a system where there is no accountability for power, but it is in direct conflict to our humanity and what we know to be right.  I am in the position of having a strict set of personal morals that I have never had to compromise.

      "Hello.  Can you please bear with me re the categories as I have a massive amount of data to input.  Unfortunately, I do not have very much time to spend on the project and all my data has to be reformatted to meet Wikipedia’s tagging standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have amended the categories because they lacked structure and there is need for a systematic approach.  A friend, who is a postal expert but only an occasional computer user, told me he was going round in circles trying to tie up relevant articles.  I am an IT professional and even I struggled to make any sense of the category structure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There should be a single root category and in this case philately is the obvious choice since that is the umbrella term for the entire pursuit.  Philately itself is a hobby or pastime or subject or whatever so it is entirely reasonable that it should also be a sub-category of those wider categories.  I found that philately had such as postage stamps, postal markings and postal history as sub-categories but philately was also a sub-category of each of those, which is nonsense and does not help new users.  Equally, similar articles such as the postage stamps of a particular country were categorised across the board instead of being allocated to a single category within a hierarchical or relative structure which non-IT people like my friend can easily navigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "After I made a few amendments to the philatelic/postal categories, I asked my friend to try again and he found what he was looking for immediately.  This is the benefit of a structured, systematic approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas philately is the root, it splits into two main sub-categories.  One of these is philately ‘’per se’’ which could be defined as the study of the physical aspects of stamps (e.g., watermarks, types of paper, gums, etc.).  The other aspect is the actual issue of the stamps for postal purposes and this is all done at the behest of a postal authority (on the chicken before egg principle).  Anything to do with issuing stamps and organising collection, sorting and delivery of mail is done by a postal authority which is why we believe it must rank as a main sub-category along with “physical” philately.  The term “postal authority” is a catchall for any organisation that has issued stamps and processed mail: national government, army of occupation, foreign postal agency, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said all that, I agree that it is a good idea to categorise types of stamp independently of a country’s issues and, on that basis, “postage stamps” should be a sub-category of “philately”.  There is a clear difference between the two disciplines.  I will endeavour to make use of that difference, especially as our inputs will fall into both of those categories.\n",

What you ever did was to provide datas that at least 200 years pre that period or 300 years after. The closest data was provided by me and which either equated population for 'Armenians' or another one used the term majority, and another one only talked about the depopulation of Armenians.

It isen't enough for you that the entirity of the history of the Armenians in Nakhichevan is entirly missing from the article, for hell sake Grandmaster you even disputed that the word is generally known as Armenian, you even have a problem with the term Armenian being added anywhere or accept that Armenians for some period in the history of Nakhichevan have constituted a majority. If you are really good intentioned, I think you would not have had the problem with the word Armenian there when the history section start with trash about the etymology of the word and with referrences that aren't cited anywhere.

      "Good question. No, of course, it does bump up the principal. How about this thought experiment: for continual compounding, what if the payment is not made continuously? I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:\n",
      " The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.\n",
      " So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.\n",
      " If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).\n",
      " In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).\n",
      " Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point \"\"they\"\" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.\n",

      "\n",
      "The theory of Liszt's revolutionising piano playing was apparently an invention of Lina Ramann. She had in November 1876 asked Liszt whether his \"\"Umwälzung der Klaviertechnik\"\" (\"\"Revolution of piano technique\"\") had been due to Paganini's Caprices. on December 1 Liszt wrote to this that it was his biographer who had to decide, since he himself was unable to take an objective point of view towards his foolish own productions. It was his only consolation that they could have become even worse after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lina Ramann's \"\"decision\"\" can be found in her Franz Liszt als Künstler und Mensch, Erster Band, Zweites Buch, p.106. According to this, Liszt's hands had been rather small and could hardly stretch a 9th. From Paganini's Caprices, according to Ramann, Liszt took the idea how to play wider intervals, and this was his entire \"\"revolution\"\". Ramann's theory is of course wrong. There were others who wrote wide intervals as well (for example Schumann, Chopin, Henselt, Thalberg, Döhler, Dreyschock and many further ones). To this comes that the theme of Liszt's Clochette-Fantasy was not taken from Paganini's Caprices, but from a violin concerto, and that there are no extraordinarily wide intervals in this particular piece. It is to be presumed that Liszt himself read Ramann's theory with astonishment.85.22.19.160  \"\n",

      "You reduce \"\"false rape\"\" claims to people (women) changing their minds. But if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. It can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. Ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. Cooperation does not imply consent. And you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. Don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?\n",

      "I am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, I am aware of that. What I am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. If rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. This would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.\n",

From experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "You bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of \"\"sex by force\"\". You have some pretty messed up ideas. Drugs are force. For example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as \"\"non-lethal force\"\". Similiar to another example, where people are \"\"just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you\"\" - holding someone down - by force - is force. Locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).\n",

      "The second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. Yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms.

So, women have an easier time to carry guns. \n",

      "Every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. Because violence is the very foundation of a state - The state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. But when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. Aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. As such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.\"\n",

Nowhere it says that they were under orders of the Wehrmacht, but that they were in close cooperation. I'll quote it for you: Each Einsatzgruppe was led by SD, Gestapo and Kripo officers, and its members included recruits from the Orpo, the Waffen-SS, and local volunteers, such as militia groups. Each death squad followed the Wehrmacht Heer (German Army) as it advanced eastwards through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. During the course of their operations, the Einsatzgruppen commanders were authorized to request, and did receive, assistance from the Wehrmacht. Heydrich acted under orders from Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler who supplied security forces on an \"\"as needed\"\" basis to the local SS and Police Leaders. They were different organizations. The Wehrmacht could not give order to the SS. Again, from that article: The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich (deputy to Heinrich Himmler) and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. From September 1939 forward the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA – Reich Main Security Office)[4] had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.\n",

The following passage is singular in that respect: “I don’t understand. Who should we take our orders from, in the end? From Reichenau or Jeckeln? And where is Brigadeführer Rasch?”—“I don’t know, Sturmbannführer.”. I suggest changing \"\"attached\"\" to \"\"worked closely with\"\", \"\"cooperated\"\" or something like that.\n",

      "As for the sentence the Sixth Army, the AOK 6, to which we were attached, Littell originally used the verb \"\"rattacher\"\", auquel nous étions rattachés, which is usually translated as \"\"linked\"\", \"\"connected\"\" or \"\"associated\"\".

BobJoeBob has 7 siblings Fred,8 Candy,6 Diamond,5 Angel,4 Tiara,3 Princess,11months and flower,2months. BobJoeBob's mother Muriel Sadie Mary was only 12 when she fell pregnant with BobJoeBob. The father was Muriel Sadie Mary's preeteen love Raybilly. When BobJoeBob's nan found out that BobJoeBob's mother was pregnant she kicked them out, Raybilly's parens were not that suportive either but at least they helped out with finances! The family of 12 year olds mooved into a quante little trailor just a few kilometers from Raybillies family. Soon after BobJoeBob was born Raybilly (who looks old for his age) opened up his own buisness, unfortunately in 2000, when Fred was bord the buisness went under. Raybilly feared the worst and fled with the 15 year olds savings. Muriel sadie Mary was devostated but somehow carried on. over the next 10 years she had another 6 kids all with different parents. Bur in January 2010 the silver lining came for BobJoeBob, he found Captain. Captain is a former sailor, who loved his rum and unfortunately had a few altercations while under the influence of alcahol! Now the 2 reside in Jacksonville on a cosy houseboat. Muriel sadie Mary has  found herself a man, a vey rich man.... lets hope she can keep this guy for longer than 2 kids! \n",

While I have made mistakes in the past, I assure you I am committed to only contributing to wikipedia. \n",

      "I am angry because the last time I was blocked was completely unfair. I was issued a warning because I posted \"\"I love you\"\" on two users talk pages. While they took this as a joke, I took it as my try to make peace with these people that i felt wronged me in the past. I'm sorry if \"\"love\"\" is considered a joke around here. While I tried explaining that I should not be warned for something like this, they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me, instead of being responsible admins. As a result, they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week. While on this ban, they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet, because this user claimed he was me in an edit. Everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit. Since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine, they extended the block to 1 month, to further keep me quiet. I, obviously finding this as unfair, decided to request an unblock, because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block. Since this was a way of me speaking out, they rejected and even protected my page, which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it. \n",

If you can help in any way, that would be appreciated.

Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.

      "As with a lot of the details of Plato's life, there is no contemporary source concerning this story.  It comes from Diodorus' Library 15.7, Plutarch's Dion 4-5, and Diogenes Laertius' Lives 13.18-21.  (In the link to the Diogenes translation, the story begins under \"\"XIV\"\", but it's technically 13.18 of Diogenes' text.)  The three accounts differ in details, and it's not known how true any of them are.  The incident is not (I believe) even mentioned in the notorious Seventh Letter, which was written in or very near Plato's time.  We must keep in mind that in the centuries following great figures like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle a lot of purportedly \"\"biographical\"\" information was simply made up out of whole cloth, sometimes for the purpose of scandal, sometimes just to fill in the gaps.  The ancient Greek scholars Kirk, Raven, & Schofield speak of \"\"the great period of fictitious biography in the third and second centuries [B.C.]\"\" (The Presocratic Philosophers, Cambridge, 1983, 2nd edition, p. 81).    \"\n",

      "Hi there,\n",
      "I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller. \n",
      "As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names.\n",
      "I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards). \n",

Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.

I was puzzled at the time, and now today you have reverted the inclusion of a terms category in a concepts category. (I am wondering if that was you not too long ago). I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be \"\"thought of\"\"). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many \"\"terminology\"\" categories, and I basically see them as \"\"junk\"\" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from \"\"terminology\"\" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of \"\"concepts\"\".

It doesn't matter how long you've lived in whatever region; that doesn't mean you know anything about the dialect that's spoken there.  No offense, that's just how it is.  I lived in the Midland for most of my life, but that doesn't mean I know squat about the dialect spoken there.  I'm sure there are linguists who know way more than I do about the Midland dialect.  I can speak it, but that doesn't mean I know much about it.  People don't seem to understand this concept.  Also, personal experience doesn't mean anything on Wikipedia, no matter how true or false it is.  It's called \"\"original research\"\" here.  There's no need to get angry about this stuff; it's just linguistics; it's not like anyone insulted your mother or your cat or whatever you hold dear.  Keep in mind also that it is possible to live in a region one's entire life and not speak with the accent associated with that region, i.e., some people in the South have accents that are more similar to those of the West or Midland.  The same might be true for the Inland North.  Read this.  Specifically read p. 139 where it says Transitional Cities.  It explains this a little bit, though not as much as I would want it to.  Maybe you can find a more in depth explanation elsewhere, like in the real Atlas of North American English.  That's all I have to say.   \"\n",

I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago.

That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think.

      "The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what \"\"Sanskrit\"\" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate \"\"Sulat Bisaya\"\" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called \"\"regional scripts\"\" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern \"\"Kulitan\"\" or \"\"Súlat Kapampangan\"\" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it \"\"sus letras\"\" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature.

Some editors rushed to introduce multiple Nazi references into the article, and I object to using such analogies as disrespectful to Soviet war dead, but we can't make judgement calls on what to or not include based on our own sensitivities. The editor who objected is a new editor, and whilst we welcome new editors by not biting them, they will learn the above in good time and come to accept that this how WP operates. So having said that, the Chavez quote needs to be placed in its entireity as it was written, as we are not WP:CENSORED.

      "\":LOL, gee, I wish you were part of WP:Canada.  I've tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down, rather patronizingly too.  They're supposed to be parallel to \"\"People from Whatcom County\"\" or \"\"People from Oxfordshire\"\" but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are, especially not in terms of any self-referential \"\"this is where I'm from sense\"\".  Unless you mean all \"\"people from XXX\"\" categories....in the case of regional districts, which have only existed since 1867-1968 and also do not include Indian Reserves in their governance, and have extremely limited powers (sewer, zoning, some planning and disaster management), they're not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with Indian Reserves or people from them; some users, like User:Backspace, and I, got into something like edit wars over his/her labelling objects like mountains, lakes, etc with them, and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way (different branch of the governance system, namely Ministry of Environment); there's also, y'see, Forest Districts and Forest Regions, Land Districts (which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind), Ministry of Environment Regions (for parks theoretically but BC Parks, has its own system within MoE), Health Regions (hospitals, etc), School Districts, \"\"Counties\"\" (which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life), Development Regions (which ARE relevant to daily life and provincially-kept statistics, though tey're formed from aglloomerations/boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively), and BC Tourism (http://www.hellobc.com) has its OWN system of regions.  The rationale provided by the regional district categories-defenders is that because it's the system that StatsCan uses to divvy up BC for the census, i.e. counting people, then it \"\"makes sense\"\" to use them as geographic subdivisions for \"\"where people are from\"\".  But it just doesn't make sense....the problem now is that there's all kinds of mirrored wiki-clones which ahve statments like \"\"XXX Mountain is a mountain in the such-and-so regional district\"\", though the more relevant reference is \"\"in the such-and-so mountain range\"\" or \"\"in the xxx Country/Valley\"\" (in BC there's lots of historical region-references of the \"\"Nicola Country\"\", \"\"Shuswap Country\"\", \"\"Omineca Country\"\" type, sometimes capitalized, though often not, and often just \"\"the Shuswap\"\", \"\"the Okanagan\"\", \"\"the Omineca\"\" etc, and regional district names, and also electoral district names, are often \"\"built out of them\"\", e.g. Columbia-Shuswap, Okanagan-Similkameen; but I've also seen translated categories/articles saying \"\"Fraser Valley\"\" when meaning the Fraser Valley Regional District; the problem is that only half of the Fraser Valley is even IN the regional district of that name (the rest is in the Greater Vancouver one), and similarly the Cariboo Regional District doesn't include all of the Cariboo, and itself includes a region known as the Chilcotin.  I've created categories for most of those areas, and a parallel hierachy for same, but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can't be cited easily; even though they're what people actually use and historically pre-date even the province itself.......there's some subcategories using that format e.g. Category:People from the Similkameen (where \"\"the Similkameen\"\" = \"\"the Similkameen Country\"\" and also Category:Cariboo people, although that's largely intended for historical figures from that region's glory days during the Cariboo Gold Rush and since.  In the way British Columbians actually talk, \"\"so-and-so is from the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\" would mean that that person WORKS for the Thompson-Nicola Regional District\"\", most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person.  Myself, I'd like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that; the rationale is that some other long-ago Wikipedian created the hierarchy \"\"and so we should respect that\"\", even though that person, to me, was utterly clueless and shouldn't have created them at all.  The only thing the main RD categories should be used for is the component municipalities; though there are some Electoral Areas that have articles; but ti's when those start getting used as geographic descriptors, it's entirely offbase; it's all over Googlemaps and Wikimaps, too, and it's really annoying to see; similarly the use of the French-form of Indian Reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell's half digital acreage because it's what StatsCan (wrongly) uses.  As if StatsCan were the only'' classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in Ottawa do....anyway sorry for the rant, it's been rare for me to find\n",

      "PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that \"\"a designer created flagella\"\", science says \"\"no further information known\"\". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient \"\"to know\"\" that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like \"\"legitimate possibility\"\" or \"\"probable explanation\"\". Science is far too patient to give up so quickly in the face of an unknown natural phenomenon.  \"\n",

Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed. And you know what I'm greedy for, Floquenbeam.

On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

This is nothing but just the mentioned \"\"Aborigin Rights\"\" just like most other countries, like Canada and Singapore. \"\"Ketuanan Melayu\"\" was invented, but I'm not sure when is it exactly that it was first being used. One may say it is a derivation from the Article 153, but it has gone too far from beneficial - it has been abused and being used as a tool by Barisan Nasional for their own gain. The rationale behind Hak Keistimewaan Orang Melayu is that what they claimed that Malays are the Aborigins (although I don't really agree with this, the Peranakans has settled in Malacca during the 15th centuries!) - the true Aborigins are none other than Orang Aslis. Let's assume that the fact that Malays are aborigins are true. Article 153 never introduced \"\"Malays First\"\" Policy, but rather the means to protect Malay rights as well as the rights of other races in this country. Article 153 is never controversial, but rather being ABUSED by certain politicians. I hope these makes it clear. The most prominent example that happens in this country right now is the government scholarship. You can read almost everywhere about this. Isn't this already an official discrimination? You can read more like the BTN courses who always refers the Chinese (include Peranakan generations) and Indians as \"\"pendatang\"\", but the fact is that Parameswara himself is a Pendatang, (and also Khir Toyo).\n",

      "- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n",

They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here.

But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant.

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]\n",

In several places you removed clear existing text and replaced it with confusing, even incoherent or unrelated statements.  Sub-standard English is a large part of the problem.  It might be best if you had someone check your grammar and spelling prior to editing articles, rather than work on Wikipedia alone.    \n",

It's like total blackness a dark swirling mass is below my feet in orbit. That's like a candle light halfway down my high school campus.

If you insist upon doing so, and go on in the same manner as before, your edits are almost certain to be reverted as unsourced original research or unclearly expressed.  I would advise you instead to postpone editing for now and learn as much as you can about the science, and also to concentrate on improving your command of English.   \n",

An example of such an organisation is the Hanzehogeschool Groningen.

I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous... \n",

If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the \"\"explanation\"\" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make \"\"heads and tails\"\" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )\"\n",

See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.

You'll notice most major local journalists and media personalities now have entries. Refer to [staff of WPVI in Philadelphia] where every personality has a page. In the case of the Tampa Bay market, figures such as Keith Cate, Dick Crippen and Paul Dellegatto all have pages, though only of significance to one or two media markets.

It's also what I just stated above: \"\"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying.\"\" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that \"\"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship.\"\" I state that because it's not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you've asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it's also an outdated view because of what I've noted already. It hasn't been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz's assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships.

This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn't see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don't include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn't Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn't sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn't. But I agree that it should be included in the article. \n",

The \"\"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact\"\" line is about lesbians only, and it's supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it's stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it's what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don't have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don't present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you've done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that \"\"many other sources\"\" show the opposite of the material you kept removing.

Charlie Parker revolutionized jazz by playing the sax with a classical ensamble. Stan Getz led the short but very important samba movement with his smooth style and grace on his tenor sax. Michael Brecker, who recntly died of a rare form of Lukemia ( i think), was a beast of a player that revolutionized modern jazz.

In fact, it got a lot of ink in Greil Marcus' Invisible Republic/Old, Weird America and I can't remember off the top of my head if Clinton Heylin talks about it a lot, but I always thought it was quite famous in its own right as one of the \"\"great, unreleased\"\" Basement tracks. Well, it's possible that is just my perception, but I think if in doubt we should lean towards neutral language and simply refer to it as \"\"a previously unreleased track\"\" or something like that.

      "\n",
      "First, a further clarification on the concept behind wikipedia, neutrality is a fundamental pillar, but there are two others as well, no original research and verifiability.  This takes us into the \"\"weasel words\"\" you mention, which it's true is an area where improvements are needed with the article.  A reader should be able to independently check everything written in a wikipedia article should they want to, and as such, wikipedia is more about providing verifiable information rather than what a given editor simply thinks or believes is \"\"true.\"\"  You specifically cite the Criticism section, and I agree.  \"\"Plagiarism\"\" has evolved the furthest of the three subsections IMO and is solidly referenced with verifiable sources (I think the believer stance(s) aren't presented as well as they could though), and the same should probably be done for \"\"Science\"\" and \"\"Revelation\"\".  For instance, one thing that can be done for \"\"Revelation\"\" is cite the low book sales and distribution of the TUB instead of the simple current statement that it isn't widespread.  \"\"Peacock terms\"\" have been an ongoing challenge from my perspective, commonly inserted throughout the article in a way that aggrandizes the book, but I think this is currently toned down.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I'm hearing from you Hanely overall is a suggestion to focus on TUB alone, make the article perhaps a book summary with some history added, and put everything else in other articles.  It is one way to go, and you specifically mention Criticism-related topics as being placed elsewhere.  This would also need to be true of the adherents section and anything \"\"pro\"\".  I don't agree with this tactic however, for reasons of wikipedia policy and overall usefulness to the average reader.  What makes TUB interesting and worth writing & reading about is that it purports to be more than a typical religious book, and people accept it as such.  I think that is a highly intertwined element of the TUB topic, and it fits in this article, and by the same token the reasons people *don't* accept it as such is part of the story.  I think it is a challenge to have the article reflect these differing perspectives, but that's a basic challenge involved with wikipedia articles in a nutshell.  Writing separate articles for separate points of view is discouraged.  See POV forking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think there needs to be a top-level article that is a summary of The Urantia Book basics, its teachings, its history, and those who are pro and con on topics related to it.  Other articles can then develop certain topics in more depth, if needed or wanted.  I don't see why the top-level article shouldn't be this one, it already serves as that, and other similar topics on wikipedia are structured the same way (for instance A Course in Miracles isn't a simple book synopsis & some words about the history, but covers pro and con viewpoints, as does Book of Mormon, which also has a plagiarism section).  I certainly do not accept that for some reason everything to do with Criticism should be tucked away in separate articles.  This is inherently biased toward the idea that the main wikipedia article is only for those seeking viewpoints where nothing negative is said.  Audiences also come to learn about contrary viewpoints, and those viewpoints are just as valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the points you brought up, my thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  I've seen a tendency over the 1+ year I've followed this wikipedia article off and on for people to add many digressions to the article.  And understandably so, TUB is enormous and has thousands of interesting details and side stories.  But not all will fit in the main article.  I've seen multiple people each add a few sentences here and there, and over time, the article has become enormous and unfocused with all sorts of illogical disorganized digressions.  Like you say, this article can stand to be streamlined (you should have seen what it's been like before!).  IMO, the Lucifer rebellion story, while interesting, doesn't quite make the cut in terms of being essential enough to mention on the main page.  Perhaps an article summarizing TUB's view of the history of earth is worthwhile to build up?  The Lucifer / Caligastia / Satan story would fit in article such as that, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.-5.  Like I've said, Criticism is appropriate to have, as is the view of believers, and a POV fork is contrary to wikipedia standards.  In terms of Gardner specifically, despite any opinions on his conclusions about TUB, his book is one of the few published about TUB to analyze it from a nonbeliever perspective and it's entirely appropriate to use and cite as reference material for the article.  I say that even though I'm not personally convinced by arguments he makes.  I've read his book, have access to a copy, and can make edits regarding i\n",

      "It is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world's only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel's right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people's right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the \"\"new anti-Semitism.\"\" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.\n",

Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel.

Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   \n",

I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.\n",

Once again, the statement about public schools and ID materials was unsourced when you first added it, which is why I removed it. Upon further examination, I removed the statement again because the article never explictly stated that the Centre for Intelligent Design was responsible for the distribution of these intelligent design materials to public schools. It is actually very unlikely that this Centre for Intelligent design did so, in light of the fact that the government proclamation was issued in 2006, and this organization arose in 2010. Finally, believing in the historicity of Adam and Eve does not make one a fundamentalist. Many Christians reconcile the Genesis creation narrative with science (see the BioLogos Foundation for example, which advocates evolutionary creation). The entire Roman Catholic Church (1 billion people) teaches the historicity of Adam and Eve and that does not make them Young Earth Creationists or fundamentalists.

I take alot of time and effort in editing this page. I don't go on your articles and consistently scrutinize and change entries you have made. I've tried being cordial, I've tried being nasty and it seems that you are just being petty about the whole matter. I created this page myself.

You are correct; I should not laugh at Danny Muse, as it is more depressing than funny to see a cult-like mentality in action, especially on the doors, where many of the public can easily be fooled by Danny's type of false reasoning if they are not careful. I was not making a \"\"personal attack\"\", I was attcking his false reasoning. All my criticism of his false manipulative arguments, and deliberate attempts at deceit all still stand. Interesting, I see you do not criticise him for calling people \"\"idiots, and pigs\"\", why is this Tom? Is there one rule for some and a blind spot for others? Danny needs to realise that if he is to make a case, it has to be rational, not wild negative propaganda, and slippery false reasoning, regardless of his religion training him this way, it is not an excuse for him to use manipulative twisted reasoning here, hoping no one will perceive it. His veiled deceit and lying conclusions to incorrect points he makes all the time should be outed where seen.

      "As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: \"\"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and \"\"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group\"\". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression \"\"telephone centrals\"\" instead of \"\"exchanges\"\" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called \"\"Propaganda Wars Returns\"\".  \"\n",

For example, Bulgarian is routinely regarded as a language most distant from the Slavic type and very difficult to understand for most Slavs. In Czech, there even exists a saying \"\"speaking like a Bulgarian\"\" for unintelligible speech. Yet the difficulties in understanding lie mainly in grammar (the non-existence of word-endings, the use of articles). You can listen to a Bulgarian, not to understand a word and doubt, if you are actually listening to an Indo-European language - and then you see a Bulgarian text and you are surprised that you can read it quite with ease. So the difference in understanding spoken language and written language can be huge. \n",
      "As for the difference between Czech/Slovak and Polish, I must agree with the Polish contributor above that a fluent conversation is not possible. Yet you can certainly understand a lot and conduct some conversation, if you try to be patient. So \"\"a limited intelligibility\"\" would be a more correct term. As for written Polish, Czechs and Slovaks shouldn't have any difficulties with a general understanding Polish text, although quite a few words (especially of technical sort) may seem obscure and untintelligible. However, the closest Slavic language to Czech (after Slovak) is Lusitan Sorbian, especially Upper Sorbian. I don't have any personal experience with this language, but from the written texts I saw I think that its resemblance to Czech can be compared to East Slovakian dialects (which means that you can understand some passages easily, but subsequently you can be lost due to accumulation of weirdly sounding words.)   \"\n",

      "That helped a lot, thanks. The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it. I'am not using that as an excuse, but you know, its just surprising(and suspicious) the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles. As a relative newbie, I find Its tough to resist intimidation and not crumble at the same time. Thanks for your reply, it was very informative, and I'am glad I was worth all that.

As for proof that people have been defining 'vestigial' with still being able to have some functions (that could have been worded better) since the theory  began, take a look at the sources I added to the Vestigial structures article. Darwin, Weismann and Wiedersheim (who is credited with coining the term 'vestigial' to refer to them) all used it in this way right from the beginning, in the 19th century.

      "\"== Discussing recombination ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently I noticed that this article uses 'genetic recombination' to refer to recombination that occurs during in meiosis and brings about genetic diversity among organisms.  This isn't necessarily correct: genetic recombination can also refer to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or V(D)J recombination, neither of which, to my knowledge, occur during meiosis or produce heritable genetic diversity among organisms.  To account for that, I think it would be helpful to replace instances of 'genetic recombination' with 'homologous recombination', the type of genetic recombination to which this article refers.  What are others' thoughts on this?  The only drawback I could see would be the slightly less reader-friendly word 'homologous'. This, however, seems clarified by the first sentence in the 'Sex and recombination' section to invoke the phrase: \"\"In the related process of genetic recombination, sexual organisms can also exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.\"\"  If the inaccessibility of the word 'homologous' were in fact a drawback, I think it would be more than compensated for by the greater accuracy of the information being presented to the reader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday I tried introducing this change, but was reverted.  In the summary of that reversion, the editor noted: \"\"why be less general? homologous excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc.\"\"  I've offered my rationale for being specific just above, but was curious about the second sentence.  If homologous recombination excludes translocations, duplications, fusions, etc., then is that somehow accounted for by other types of genetic recombination, like NHEJ or V(D)J recombanation?  To my understanding, it is a failure of homologous recombination in meiosis that produces heritable chromosome translocations, fusions, and gene duplications.    \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you are correct, being more accurate is better since the sentence does refer specifically to matching chromosomes. I've reworded this to state In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. I've added the idea of general recombination to the previous section, adding Mutations can involve large sections of DNA becoming duplicated, usually through genetic recombination.   \n",

      "I have noticed that some contributors to this article seem to be desperate to wash over the parallels between Islam and Islamist terrorism. You need not look further than the term \"\"Islamist terrorism\"\" itself, which is improper grammar in English. I believe that the term is preferred to \"\"Islamic terrorism\"\" because the latter seems, in their minds, to connote that terrorism is sanctioned in the religion. I personally despise this kind of thinking because it assumes that the reader is a moron who cannot discover the truth. I have seen this kind of handling of controversial subjects in other articles. I have even seen attempts to delete articles of that type from Wikipedia. I should probably note here that I am a liberal with no agenda here other than to comment.

It is encyclopedic and  not factually incorrect if it states at the top of the page the the winners from 1952-1967 are the winners of the Best Foreign Award. The Best Foreign winners are winners from many different countries and the Best British winners are obviously all British and most from British films, so I feel they are very different and should be on separate pages.

      "TABIn this proposal, I will discuss why the Wikipedia definition for “Probability,” is not a good, valid definition, and needs to be changed. Probability is something that is used every day. It is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain. However, in order to further our knowledge of probability, we must truly understand the definition of the word first. According to Wikipedia, there is not a clear, valid definition for probability, and I propose to change this.\n",

      "User:Nparibello-NJITWILL/Summer 2012 | Probability\n",
      "\n",
      "TABThe given Wikipedia definition is as follows: Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.[1] The proposition of interest is usually of the form \"\"Will a specific event occur?\"\" The attitude of mind is of the form \"\"How certain are we that the event will occur?\"\" The certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number, between 0 and 1, we call probability.[2] The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur. Thus, probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a (random)event will occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is. It begins with, “Probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain.” The word ordinarily is not only ambiguous, but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about. Aside from the ambiguity, the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well. Although I am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree, but also on my own to further my knowledge, I still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant. I would not consider probability an attitude of mind, because this simply does not make sense. The “proposition of interest” and “attitude of mind” are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability. Probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event. \n",
      "TABThe given Wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is, rather than defining it. It states that, “The proposition of interest is usually of the form…” This is not only an example instead of a definition, but it is an extremely poor example. The word usually is very vague, leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time. The definition also ends with probability in an applied sense. But what does that really mean? Because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to, this makes the definition unclear.\n",
      "TABThe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between 0 and 1. For anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense, this definition most likely makes little sense. The way it is written is very vague, but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from 0 (the event will definitely not occur), to 1 (the event will definitely occur). These ranges are also often written in percent form, 0% to 100%. I believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages, the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid. The range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome. While this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability, I would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense, even though definitions should not include examples. For example, the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is .5, or 50%. This is because there are two possible outcomes, heads or tails, and both are equally likely. If the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides, the probability of landing heads would be 1, or 100%, since there are no other possible outcomes. As stated in the original definition, “The higher the probability of an event, the more certain we are that the event will occur.”\n",

      "TABTwo good quality sources comes from Richard L. Sheaffer in his book, Introduction to Probability and Its Applications, and Glenn Shaffer in his book Probability and Finance. Both Sheaffer and Shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges, including NJIT. Both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability, making them two of the best sources for this proposal. From a mathematical standpoint, Richard Sheaffer states that “Probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number P(A) to every event A so that the following axioms hold: P(A) >= 0, and P(S) = 1.” Glenn Shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy, les\n",

I did do a Factiva search yesterday evening and came up with nothing. Whatever the Serbian editors say, highly-popular political songs do get newspaper coverage outside their country if they really are that notable, even if they're in a foreign language. Der Steuersong, for example, a satirical German song about ex-Chancellor Schröder (in German, with lots of untranslatable German puns), turns up 67 hits on Factiva. Germany may be richer, but then we were at war with Serbia, so I really do believe that someone would have taken notice if the song's notability was as high as is claimed. (talk)\n",

      "Well thank you for finally having the courtesy to participate in the discussion. In response. 1)Yes, I agree that there is a perception of overlap between ALSF, the yl's and so forth. This perception however is an inaccurate one. One only need do factiva searches on the hostility between alsf and the yl's in the 1980's and 1990's for instance. Indeed in some states liberal students and young liberals have nothign to do with each other still. In contrast to the YL's, the ALSF is not considered part of the Liberal Party, and the party has no authority over it. If you have any suggestions as to how I can make this clearer on the ALSF page, I shall be more than happy to take this on board. 2)Stating that the YL's and Liberal Students in NSW have worked together and held joint functions does nothing to counteract what i just said. I fail to see the relevance. Furthermore, we're talking about joint functions between the NSW Liberal Students Association and the YL's, not alsf. 3)Most importantly, what on earth does this have to do with the issue at hand, regarding Macquarie Uni? I really can't see it. Again I ask, is there ANYTHING in the media, or anywhere other than with two Wiki editors that links the actions of Victor to ALSF? If you can find something, please, put it up, i'll retract all my comments. I just honestly can't see how it is relevant.\n",

At the very least there is an English translation and obviously the original German version. As there is an Estonian translation, then likely there would be a Finnish one too, and Russian as well if this translator is over 40. Being the USA, I don't think a Spanish version would be difficult to come by.

She was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second. My mother's case was not hereditary. She has a very odd case. They were never sure EXACTLY what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life (well she was about 8 or 9 months old at the time of her first ever seizure) but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth.

When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly.

      "The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.\n",

I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.\n",

      "Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' \"\"solution\"\".\n",

The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island.

      "This was to judge by appearances. As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

      "up, Martinez decided to law low from the city for a while, but eventually came back to mess with Vic’s woman, Louise. Since the failed deal, the Vance brothers were forced to do business with the Mendez brothers. This was around the time the Vances built their own organization in power, taking over businesses from rival gangs. Victor did help with a transgender get things straight and met Phil Collins and his manager. At first, it was believed that the Mendez Cartel wanted to establish a business relationship, but their real plan was to have the Vances give their businesses to the Mendez’s and leave Vice City, or the Vance brothers and Louise would die. When they refused, the Cartel kidnapped them and took them near the Escobar International Airport. The brothers blew the death row and stopped Mendez’s men from taking over their businesses. Their plans were foiled. They kidnapped Louise and threatened to kill her if the brothers didn’t leave the city. Not long before the Vances storm into their mansion in Prawn Island. Lance was held hostage, while Victor proceeded through the gangsters and killed Armando Mendez. Louise was left on the floor dying, next to Lance. A vengeful Victor formed an alliance with Ricardo Diaz (a crime lord) to bring down the Mendez’s operations once and for all. Victor invaded into the military base, stole their army helicopter, and returned it to Diaz’s mansion in Starfish Island. Once back in the chopper, Victor said he would owe Ricardo nothing and was doing this for him. After that, he flew to the Mendez penthouse and killed all the Mendez henchmen at the building in downtown. Jerry Martinez arrived in the scene and was prepared to kill Victor. Finally at the rooftop, in the final confrontation, Jerry Martinez cornered Vic, believing he was too easy to trick. Diego Mendez came and the final shootout between the 3 men led to the deaths of Diego and finally Jerry. Lance came into the scene and but it was already over. The Vance men decided to lay low with the drug money they made to take care of their sick brother outside the country. Vice City became the major spot for the drugs trade, it attracted several criminal organizations to be interested, including the Mafia. Liberty City’s Mafia-linked Forelli family sent Tommy Vercetti, who was recently released from prison after a 15-year stay, down “South” to get started with their expansion, with Vercetti as a Forelli representative, just to keep him out of Liberty City. Upon arrival to Vice, Tommy and 2 other men (later learned to be Harry and Lee) met Ken Rosenberg, a bent lawyer with Forelli connections, at the airport. They soon met with the Vance family leaders at the docks to make the deal. However, 3 masked men killed everyone but Tommy, Ken, and Lance who managed to escape without the money and drugs. Tommy informed Sonny Forelli about the incident. An angered Forelli demanded that Tom found his money and drugs immediately and get those responsible for the incident. Rosenberg feared to suffer consequences from the mob and refused to stick his head of his office. Sonny called periodically to check up on Vercetti. A man for information was Kent Paul, who gave info about a chef. Tommy killed Leo Teal, who failed to squeal about the ambush. With nowhere to go, Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez, who also set up the deal, was his way in to find the money. He was at his most expensive yacht. Cortez had a feeling that his right-hand man Gonzales squealed about the deal and was to be killed, and met Lance Vance. Vercetti met Avery Carrington, a Southern gent who was into prime real estate. Tommy met Ricardo Diaz, now a powerful coke baron. After watching a deal, Diaz offered Vercetti work since he liked his style. Soon after working for him, Lance and Tom discovered that Ricardo was responsible for their busted deal. Lance attempted earlier to avenge his brother but failed only to be captured and taken to the city’s junkyard before Tommy came to the rescue. Before they could their revenge, Tommy escorted Colonel Cortez out of the city after a corrupt French government was after Cortez for assigning Tommy to steal their merchandise earlier. The men finally stormed in the Diaz’s mansion grounds and killed the drug master. Diaz trusted and was going to have him made, but he was made by the 2 men. Tommy took over all his local businesses. The Forellis sent Vercetti some support, later forming his own organization in the progress while gaining power. Tommy decided to go solo and form alliances with Cuban (now in feud with a Haitian gang) and biker gangs, including Love Fist. He owned a protection racket, several assets, including the Malibu, a Pole Position strip club, a porn studio, Kaufman Cabs Company, a car dealership shop, a boatyard down the docks, and a printing company, and in progress making acquaintances with other powerful people of the criminal underworld. Through those progresses, he performed robbery on a bank, produced porn films,\n",

No, all jokes aside, making the philosophical implications of three-ness a major point of the article is only inviting me to come along and argue with you.  My religion and natural philosophy is centered around the number five, which means you're wrong.  I know you're wrong because I am a priest (and a docktor) who has spent much time studying the mystickal properties of the number 5 and how it relates the to number 3 (and the number 2 - this is very important).  I think overall my philosophy overall has as much merit as that of Mr. Pierce.  Whether you interpret that as praise towards me or an insult towards the late C.S. is entirely up to you.  But ultimately neither have a place on this page.  Now, if you asked me, a list of stories with the number three in the title also doesn't belong here.  Maybe on the disambig page - \"\"3 can mean.... literature: The Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, Three Blind Mice, etc.\"\"  Three Bears is a popular Russian chocolate candy, do we include that here as well?  I can see how cases where the numeral 3 is used in common classification systems - such as the periodic table, or even positions in sports (the first baseman is literally referred to as \"\"3\"\" in phrases such as \"\"4-6-3 double play\"\"), but things like \"\"three witches in macbeth\"\" seem much more eehhhhhhhh.  maybe this is an issue to be argued with the whole wikinumbers project.  i only have issue with this page because when i stumbled on it some 10 months ago it actually had A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AMOUNT of unnecessary, marginally significant, and horribly formatted content, and I actually want this website to be good and useful instead of a godawful pile of crap.

However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

Surely native spanish speakers themselves would not get confused between \"\"indígena\"\" and references to the East Indies (\"\"las Indias Orientales\"\"). Whether Columbus really believed what he wrote about reaching the Indies, we can only speculate- Eratosthenes's relatively accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference was only one estimate amongst many, was not generally held, and AFAIK we've nothing to indicate that Columbus accepted or relied on this figure. | TALK 02:49, 2005 September 5 (UTC)   \n",

Structural geology is the study of structures (folds, faults, etc) within the rocks at scales varying from microscopic to continental. Now of course they are interrelated. Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.\n",

This alone is not an indictment, but if you examine the actions he did NOT take, particularly his passionate, 20-point defense of WMC after one of WMC's temper tantrums, his harsh actions against skeptics are all the more suspect.

Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:\n",
      "The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. \n",
      "The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. \n",
      "The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. \n",
      "The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. \n",
      "The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.\n",
      "The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.\n",
      "The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed \"\"The SES\"\") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. \n",
      "The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. \n",

Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%. According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldn’t then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%, if you look at the Aregentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has ameridian ancestory, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white?

The Philosophy of Chiropractic far exceeds a modality (manual/mechanical manipulation) and a lesion (vertebral subluxation/joint dyskinesis). It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, anyone who knows a lick of neurology realizes that there neurophysiological effects of manipulation and, similarly, there are neurophysiological effects of joint dyskinesis/subluxation.   However, these are being taken in a neuromusculoskeletal context now as well as possible autonomic implications on visceral functions that may arise from chronic NMS pain syndromes.  This is a contemporary view of the profession.\n",

Rather we are holistic NMS doctors with an emphasis on manual therapies and other complementary therapies.  We;re not wannabe MDs or \"\"glorified PTs\"\".  DCs trained in scientific schools are perfectly positioned to play a crucial role in managing and preventing NMS issues and PCP role.  \n",
      "I would encourage you, Fyslee, to visit the CCA website or the new OCA one and you tell me that my sole purpose is to rid subluxations.  It is, at least in Canada, a dying faction as CMCC and UQTR embrance scientific chiropractic and not traditional/philosophical (straight) chiropractic.\n",

The evidence-based Doctor of Chiropractic in 2008 is not tied down to the philosophy of subluxations (metaphysically) or at least in Canada (my POV which conflicts with your chiropractic POV which is US and not a world wide one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, every DC since 2002 has been educated in the integrative EBM curriculum (CMCC is 45 minutes away from McMaster University, where evidence based medicine was born) Canada, unlike the US has NO subluxation based schools and they are both university degree granting institutions.  This is important because credits obtained at CMCC and UQTR can be TRANSFERRED to public universities unlike before.\n",

There is a template (Template:Cite video) that can be used to cite a video available though a URL but, obviously, you'd have to be sure that the URL steers clear of Wikipedia:Copyright violations. Personally, I would suggest not to use the film as a source for this sort of thing because secondary sources are always better, if available. Also, you want to avoid violating WP:SYNTH which is done when you present a conclusion that you reached yourself by citing a primary source. But, if you do decide to cite the film as a source, you can use reference #68 from this version of Children of Men as a guide of how to format a citation to the actual film.  (talk • contribs) \"\n",

After that, the new New York City Police Department took over the responsibility for criminal investigations and arrests. As recently as 1942, the Sheriff was also responsible for manning and administering the city's jails, a duty now carried by the Department of Correction. Today, the sheriff's primary duties are enforcing court-ordered judgments and fines, including unpaid parking tickets and littering fines, and collecting judgments from reluctant losers in private lawsuits, said John George, the Sheriff's executive assistant. \"\"\n",

When you say \"\"the supposed spirit of the \"\"new Northern Ireland\"\" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.   \n",

      "\n",
      "Candid Camera had its roots in Six Photographers, a groundbreaking exhibition held in Sydney in May 1955, which concentrated on what was still a relatively new development in Australian photography and featured the work of Max Dupain, David Potts, Axel Poignant, Gordon Andrews, Kerry Dundas and Hal Missingham.Robinson, Julie \"\"Candid Camera: Australian Photography 1950s–1970s\"\" Art Gallery of South Australia exhibition catalogMcDonald, Patrick \"\"The Way We Were\"\" The Advertiser, 20 May 2010 AdelaideNow websiteNewton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055) The work of the first three of these artists is also represented in Candid Camera. Six Photographers, an artist-initiated show that featured 200 images at a time when exhibitions of personal photographic work were rare, was regarded as sufficiently influential for the Art Gallery of New South Wales to commemorate it with a show of the same name featuring the same six photographers, more than 50 years after it had first been presented.Newton, Gael \"\"Shades Of Light: Photography And Australia 1839-1988\"\" Collins Australia, 1988 (ISBN 0732224055)Newton, Gael \"\"Silver And Grey: Fifty Years Of Australian Photography 1900-1950\"\" Angus & Robertson, 1980 (ISBN 0207141096)Art Gallery of New South Wales Exhibitions Archive AGNSW websiteAllen, Christopher \"\"Decisive Moments\"\", The Australian, 27 February 2010 The Australian website This second version of Six Photographers featured 29 images, many of them shown in 1955, and concentrated on works from the same period (the late forties through to the mid-fifties).\n",
      "\n",
      "Candid Camera, while about half the size of the 1955 Sydney exhibition, covered a significantly wider range of artists and looks not just at the foundations of Australian social documentary photography but at the era that curator Julie Robinson clearly regards as its golden age – the fifties, sixties and seventies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with the statements issued by the six photographers group, Candid Camera featured “images which appear unposed, spontaneous, or with their subjects captured unaware”. Though the majority of the photos in the exhibition (more than 80 in total) were taken in Australia, images by Australian photographers working overseas were also included.Allen, Christopher \"\"Unguarded Moments\"\", The Australian, 17 July 2010 The Australian websiteEmmett, Patrick \"\"Candid Camera\"\" ABC Television interview, originally broadcast on Stateline, 28 May 2010 ABC website Subjects included youth subcultures, newly arrived migrants, nuns, a number of prime ministers (though not all were in office at the time of the photo), musicians such as Bon Scott of AC/DC, and ordinary people in everyday settings: at work, at the beach and at bus stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Photographers represented in Candid Camera included Max Dupain, David Moore, Jeff Carter, Max Pam, Robert McFarlane, Mervyn Bishop, Rennie Ellis, Carol Jerrems and Roger Scott and a number of others. Of those named, all have work held in the permanent collection of National Gallery Of Australia. Mervyn Bishop is the only Aboriginal Australian to have been included, and though his work has primarily been in New South Wales, Robert McFarlane was the only photographer to be born in South Australia. In this last regard, Candid Camera was very different to Century In Focus, an earlier large-scale photographic survey curated by Robinson, which dealt only with images taken in South Australia.Robinson,\n",

It's a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists.\"\" And Blueboar's statement (\"\"If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory\"\") is valid and useful in this discussion.\n",

      "Ukufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you. For example, if you think parts need further toning-down, quote the current sentence as it appears in the article and then provided what you think would be a better way to say it. You're going to have to play nice or not play at all.\n",

      "Heyland factor is probably used more often in Europe, or even not given any formal name as such, but the derivation is as shown and has been very common for over a century. The 'Heyland factor', or it's unidentified equivalent, is how you derive transformer or motor from short-circuit and open-circuit measurements, which is a classical approach to doing it and which Leakage inductance article has been trying to describe incorrectly for several years. This stuff is proposed in Leakage inductance article, not in Transformer article proper. I am not proposing anything major in difference in Transformer article proper. Right now, everything about Leakage inductance is nonsense, so the alternative is to scrap Leakage inductance article. But there can be no doubt about the substance of the derivation per se. One may quibble with the presentation and the naming of this stuff but not with the substance. I will address these issues in proposed changes to Leakage inductance article. You are the one who suggested to start with ideal transformer and to first with linear (cum real) transformer. So back to the question: How do you fill the gaps between ideal and real? That is what the 'Heyland' derivation answers.\n",

Kinda like /b, isn't it.) who simply detest the game for its rude community that now believes (Completely on west, and to a certain extent on other servers) that attacking new players for the simple fact that they are new, and booting downloaders without consideration or remorse. Non-moderated games are filled with leavers. And now the banlist extends to games other than DotA, where normal players may be banned for abusive reasons (Beating the host, using novel and effective non-cheating strategies, etc). DotA has overrun Battle.Net with a storm of absolute idiots. The intelligent fraction of DotA players does not nearly make up for the fact that now small, promising maps are being shoved aside by DotA (Look at Obsidian Depths. Look at Mana Clash. Look at Advent of the Zenith.) because it isn't to that community's preference.\n",

Did you that 42270 gallons went to waste last week in the city and that the supervising engineer went missing, I for the first time  didnt care. Officially taking a leave of absence for a month. Tony, dont tell me about Muñoz, quizas un indepedesitanta como yo, que se quedo callado, porque se enamoro de una gringa. I live in the subur, drive an upper class car, I am actor como una telenovela de telemundo, I am Muñoz enamorado de las cosas gringas pero soñando con indepedencia, y escuachando salsa mientras trabajo en una oficina . Tony , I confess I am puerto rican living the american dream.  but also dreaming about Agueybana, also running the streets of Jayuya and listening to Blanca Canales. Please write more, about Puerto Ricans fighting in World War II, Purto Rican working for NASA, puerto Ricans being the best, of the best. keep the spirit of Agueybana alive, he in the front of the line, easy target of el arquebuz, keep the spirtit alive, tell me something about Muñoz, tell me something about Albizu, but please dont be quiet, tell me anything that keep me believing in our island.   \n",

For example, a prior discussion: The whole story of Frank Dux and the Kumite is a fraud. There is no such thing as the \"\"Kumite\"\" tournament.\n",

Anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. Wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? What about the families of the fighters? Wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? Dux himself claims that there were fatalities. In that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? Dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? To this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate Dux's claims.\n",

Someone wouldn't just \"\"jump into\"\" such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. They would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of Dux's participation in such events. He is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing that's been knocked out here is Dux's credibility. Soldier of Fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. Using the Freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. He could have never served in Vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. They exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service.

IF you really think that that news report has relevance to the article, please expound your arguments hereinafter. I shall be most glad to see them. My view is that simply citing Putin on the missiles is quite meaningless, without experts′ analysis or at least commentary. This is a rather arcane and non-transparent subject. 40 new missiles announced (mind you, not put in service, but merely announced as a plan). So what? Is this more than last year, or fewer than prior? What meaning does it have, if it has any at all? Russia still has a largely Soviet-era nuclear arsenal, ergo, most of its ballistic missiles are technically past the expiry date and RF has been supposed to DEcommission hundreds of missiles each year for the past 20 years or so (which is not to say it has been doing it!). Meanwhile, as far as is publicly known, it has been commissioning about half a dozen, or a dozen on a good year. Thus overall, its nuclear arsenal has steadily shrunk. So far there is no info that this decline has been reversed. If SUCH news appears, THAT'll be relevant and notable!\n",

C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27\n",

We know who Bud Grant is, we know who the Minnesota Vikings are, and there's only one football league on the planet, and it's NOT the pimple-faced CFL.  And nothing anyone has ever done in the CFL merits any notice whatsoever, most particularly diluting the great contributions of this great man to a great team.  All that other trash is a distraction away from what's important, and subordinates the significance of the man, the team and the game to a whole bunch of irrelevant people that don't care anyways.  This is what happens when ivory-towered (and foreign) academics write articles they have no connection to.  Any 8th grade Minnesota drop-out understands who Bud Grant is and why he's significant, however international egg-heads might get the impression that this is a refined and polite sport played to illustrate the deep and shared spiritual values between the United States and our irrelevant neighbors to the north, instead of smash-mouth warfare on an American Gridiron managed by giants like Bud Grant.

I was not isolating to just sex, but the full spectrum, making CSA the most appropriate term. \"\"Statutory rape\"\" is not a very good term to use, because a) it is not used very often in laws themselves, but rather is a more of a pop term b)it technically only refers to intercourse and c)it can include sex with an mature but mentally handicapped adult.\n",

      "Once upon a time, there was this guy who'd edited Wikipedia anonybously for many months (let's call him Derek). Derek edited anonymously so regularly hopped from IP address to IP address. He was very happy making contributions to what he believed to be a reputable encyclopedia. He worked as a journalist at a London based newspaper in the real world, and in the virtual world, Wikipedia was one of his many hobbies, where he edited this and that and made a small difference - so he liked to think. But then Derek made a huge mistake - when he tried to take on the cyber bullies - and  and came off the worse for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the afternoon of [[Monday[[ 7 April 2008. Derek had the day off work and was online and browsing Wikipedia. He happened to click on an article about the Radio 2 traffic presenter Sally Bowsman via the random articles button, and he noticed a piece of vandalism. Derek reverted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derek's next move was to look at who had added this piece of vandalism. He knew it was against Wikipedia rules to vandalise pages, so issued a user warning to the chap involved in the vandalism. Derek then decided he would keep an eye on this individual so that he might revert any more vandalism that  might commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "And lo and behond,  did exactly that. Derek reverted more vandalism and issued further warnings. Even when  made a personal attack against Derek, accusing him of having a personal interest in these other articles, Derek issued the appropriate warning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Things eventually got to the point where  had used up his four lives - that is, he had been issued with four user warnings; and still  continued to make disruptive edits. Derek therefore decided to approach WP:AIV and report this. Derek then looked at Tom's page history and discovered that he was a regular disruptive editor with rogue edits stretching back over a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user by the name of  promptly blocked the user. But two hours later, he had what can only be described as an attack of conscience and he unblocked .  didn't really give a reason for this about face other than that he had made a mistake. There then followed some discussion between Derek and Todd, and  even threw in his two penneth. Todd suggested Derek and Tom should chill out. Derek thought that a jolly good idea, and Derek even posted a friendly message on Tom's talk page urging him to make sensible edits - after all, unconstructive edits damage the reputation of Wikipedia, and the thing which damanges Wiki's reputation further is when rogue editors are allowed to continue making rogue edits willy nilly.\n",
      "\n",

      "Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a \"\"special-operations-type\"\" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.\n",
      "I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.\n",
