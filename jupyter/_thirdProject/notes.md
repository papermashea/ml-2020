#Sample code notes:
- bertin variables produce very few image cluster results
- tested bertin variables with varying clusters
	- using 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 clusters
	- uneven distribution
	- none of these seem remotely related
ERROR line 15
	/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:9: ConvergenceWarning: Number of distinct clusters (19) found smaller than n_clusters (100). Possibly due to duplicate points in X.

  - still got clusters?
  - wow literally none of these are even in any way lol
